            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In that juncture, a certain good Hoſpitable-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being like <hi>Martha buſied about many things,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40522:5"/> and concerned ſhe was not <hi>better prepared to entertain</hi> ſome Friends brought into her Houſe upon a Surprize, her nearest Friend (as a kind of eaſie Reprimand to her) put this Queſtion at random to all, <hi>What ſhould we do to be always prepared for Heaven?</hi> Somethings for the time the Author return'd, but promiſed, as ſoon as he ſhould come home, to put in writing, for that his Friend's ſake (who was under ſome Infelicity as to his hearing) a fuller and more deliberate Anſwer to that Queſtion of ſo important a Concernment, intending then only what might ſerve that ſeaſon (or our then Caſe) and fill about a Sheet or two of Paper. But all intercourſe, betwixt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants at a diſtance, being in thoſe Parts ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the Author's Friend died, and never ſaw the Papers deſigned for him. However this gave occaſion to the Author, with deeper and more ſettled Attention to weigh the Caſe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>Which when he came to do, he could not ſatisfie himſelf with ſo <hi>narrow and perfunctory a Conſideration</hi> of it, as was that which he had <hi>firſt</hi> taken: For he eſteemed the <hi>ſame Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> would <hi>not</hi> be <hi>ſufficient,</hi> not only for <hi>all People,</hi> but even for the <hi>ſame Perſons,</hi> in all <hi>Circumſtances.</hi> Many <hi>Omiſſions</hi> of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were favourably by God over-looked, in their Wandrings through Wilderneſſes, and in the State of War enſuing, which were ſeverely puniſhed in <hi>Canaan,</hi> when the Lord had given his People <hi>reſt:</hi> And the <hi>Preparations of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> were undoubtedly more exact and Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
<pb facs="tcp:40522:5"/> as well as more Glorious than thoſe of the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> In like manner, a more <hi>Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary,</hi> and <hi>leſs diſtinct Repentance,</hi> with a kind of <hi>bold Reſignation</hi> of themſelves to God, and a <hi>conſtant Truſt on his Mercy,</hi> through Chriſt Jeſus, for pardon of Sin, together with <hi>Dependance</hi> upon his <hi>Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs</hi> in all their Ways, even ſhutting their Eyes many times againſt Dread and Doubts, and ſtill <hi>going on to commit</hi> themſelves to God's good Pleaſure, with ſorrow indeed, as to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of things, which being done, they could not undo, but <hi>never letting go their hold upon God's Mercy</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, might be, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were a <hi>State of Preparation,</hi> accepted by God from moſt People in thoſe <hi>Calamitous Days,</hi> when they had neither Opportunities of Privacy, Self-Examination, and quiet thought, much leſs of mature and Formed Devotions, nor any of their uſual Helps herein. We could not then think we had many Days, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very few Hours, to prepare for our End. Almoſt every Perſon we met or ſaw ſpoke Death to us, and then, <hi>doing what to humane Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was feaſible,</hi> was, in God's favourable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, <hi>doing what was ſufficient.</hi> But <hi>now,</hi> that we are delivered from thoſe Terrors, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not thoſe (at leaſt ſudden) Dangers, now that we ſit at Peace in our Houſes, and ſleep whole Nights quiet in our Beds, and have our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Retirement and Thought, (and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſome of us are become more thoughtful than ever.) In theſe more happy Circumſtances we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:40522:6"/> but eſteem our ſelves obliged to a <hi>Diſtincter,</hi> more <hi>Sedate,</hi> and <hi>Perfected Courſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Faith, Love, Good Works, Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, Compoſedneſs. Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> and (upon our Experience of former things,) <hi>Contempt</hi> of this uncertain, inſignificant <hi>World:</hi> And further, to the not ſuffering our Hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to cleave to the things that are ſeen. So far ought we to be from ſaying within our ſelves, <hi>Surely the bitterneſs of Death is paſt;</hi> or from <hi>putting far from us</hi> (as the manner of incorrigible People is) <hi>the Evil Day,</hi> Rather will it become Perſons in our Circumſtances to make Death familiar to us, and howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God may ſweeten our Paſſage thereto, yet to be careful we never be <hi>ſo taken with any good fare in our Journey,</hi> as to be loath <hi>to go to our long home.</hi> Certainly in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever an <hi>immoderate love of Life,</hi> an <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to die,</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable Fears of Death,</hi> may be by God excuſed, they will be leaſt born with in thoſe, who, either by the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline they have been under, <hi>might have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them,</hi> or perhaps <hi>once had:</hi> which is the Caſe of all ſuch, who having been once in a good Meaſure prepared for Heaven, and thought themſelves near it, have again returned to an Earthly ſenſual Converſation.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of theſe, <hi>God's different Expectations</hi> from Men, according to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they are, or have been in, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Death, cauſed the Author to caſt his Thoughts upon the Caſe put to him, into the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:40522:6"/> Method or Model;</hi> and to <hi>ſuit</hi> to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conditions and Circumſtances,</hi> into which Chriſtian People generally fall, a <hi>diſtinct and proper Courſe of Preſcriptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which Preſcriptions, here follow only the <hi>Firſt Set;</hi> and that accommodated, primarily (and intentionally indeed) to <hi>ſuch a State</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> and others in the <hi>Days pointed at,</hi> were in; but withal (as is both intimated in the Title Page, and more particularly ſet forth <hi>Chap.</hi> II.) moſt proper, and for the main, <hi>neceſſary for all ſorts</hi> to begin with; yea, if new to them, to be by all, and <hi>every one, ſpeedily and carefully practiſed,</hi> leſt any Accident, or unexpected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſhould put a Period to Life, before the Poſſibility of a maturer Repentance: Not to ſay, that as to too many people in divers Emergencies, and unhappy Junctures, this Part contains a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of all Preparations to them Practicable.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be convenient ſomething were ſaid here as to the <hi>Style</hi> of this Part, or the <hi>way of handling the Caſe put;</hi> which in this polite Age may to many ſeem mean, yea even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempible. But the Author hopes his Readers will be ſo prudent or favourable, as to remember, The <hi>Subject Matter</hi> here treated, is to be <hi>underſtood by the meaneſt and plaineſt people,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be made as plain as may be. The <hi>Study of ſuch Plainneſs</hi> has many times occaſioned more <hi>variety</hi> (and even Baldneſs) of <hi>Expreſſions</hi> for the ſame thing, than would have been otherwiſe pardonable; which varied Expreſſions are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put in <hi>Parentheſes,</hi> ſometimes brought in by
<pb facs="tcp:40522:7"/> 
               <hi>That is,</hi> or otherwiſe. And if the Authors In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention herein be underſtood, it will appear, this way of <hi>Explanation</hi> of a harder Word, or Form of Speech, by an eaſier, is ſeveral ways <hi>uſeful,</hi> and ſo to the generality of People far <hi>above Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi> Inſtances hereof the Judicious Reader may obſerve almoſt in every Page. But to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a few, <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. the Term, <hi>To redeem all time poſſible,</hi> is uſed. Now what the Author's meaning in that Phraſe is, every poor plain Man or Woman may not perhaps underſtand; therefore in a <hi>Parentheſis</hi> it follows <hi>(that is to make uſe of all Opportunities and Advantages thou haſt to prepare thy ſelf for the other World.)</hi> Thus it is plain to all, what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor there meant by redeeming of Time. Again, <hi>p. 22. lin. 11. Meditate,</hi> (that is, <hi>think and conſider.)</hi> Meditation is nothing but Thought and Conſideration. Sometimes again, the Particle <hi>Or</hi> is uſed to the ſame purpoſe, as <hi>That is.</hi> So, <hi>p. 47. Decalogue,</hi> or <hi>Ten Commandments.</hi> It is almoſt impoſſible to write, as our Language now ſtands, but now and then a hard or uncertain and dark Expreſſion muſt drop: But ſuch Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or aſcertaining it, as I have uſed, I hope makes amends for thoſe Miſhaps: and more needs not be ſaid on this Point.</p>
            <p>A Word or Two may be needful to be added, touching the ſeeming <hi>Meanneſs,</hi> or even <hi>Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>divers Materials</hi> and <hi>Obſervations,</hi> which go to the making up this Piece: As to which Point no more ſhall be ſaid, but that it is to be conſidered, <hi>ſundry things</hi> herein are <hi>writ</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:40522:7"/> for the <hi>meaneſt, pooreſt People</hi> that live, (for ſuch the Author has had occaſion to converſe with; and ſuch he is not aſhamed to own that he many times viſits,) People who live upon their daily Labours, nay poſſibly upon Alms. Theſe <hi>poor Creatures</hi> have <hi>Souls to ſave,</hi> as precious in the Sight of God as <hi>Rich Mens,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be exhorted and encouraged to ſuch <hi>good Works,</hi> as are incident to their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or as they are capable of. They are alſo to be ſpoken to in Language befitting their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and Circumstances. Now to ſuch as theſe it is plain the Author had an Eye, as in other places, ſo eſpecially in <hi>pag. 162, 163, &amp;c.</hi> Let all Peoples Needs be conſidered, and each ſort take their Share, and perhaps little will be found contemptible, or ſuch which might have been ſpared. And thus much as to this <hi>Firſt Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Part,</hi> fitted to Perſons of more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, and who have leiſure, and poſſibly a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of more time before them than ſome miſerable Creatures, that may be concerned in this Firſt Part, is as good as finiſh'd, and ſhall (God willing) be publiſh'd as this finds Acceptance with <hi>Serious and Devout Chriſtians.</hi> From ſuch the Author hopes he may gain ſome Intimations, both how he may amend this Part, and make the other more compleat: And the number of ſuch Souls may the God of all Grace daily encreaſe; and both perfect all that are ſuch already, and preſerve them to his Heavenly Kingdom.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 6. This Work <hi>muſt not</hi> end <hi>but with our</hi> Lives; <hi>yet is to be</hi> begun <hi>as</hi> early <hi>as may be.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THE Holy Ghoſt has aſſured us, That <hi>there is no Work, nor Device, nor Wiſdom in the Grave,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 10. But that <hi>after Death</hi> only <hi>comes Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. And, <hi>in the place where the Tree falleth there it ſhall be,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 3. <hi>That is,</hi> ſay even the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters, <hi>In the condition wherein Death finds us, God judgeth us:</hi> Immediately then upon the departure of the Soul out of the Body, the ſtate of ſuch diſſolved Perſon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40522:12"/> is everlaſtingly and unchangeably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as to his future Weal or Wo; and <hi>a Gulph fixed between</hi> the Bleſſed and the Damned, ſo that <hi>they who would paſs from</hi> one to the other, <hi>cannot,</hi> Luke 16. 26. Neither is there any return from either. Wherefore after Death, there being no preparation poſſible to be made for Judgment, it muſt unavoidably follow, Preparation for Death and Preparation for Judgment include one another, or are much the ſame; and he that is provided for one, is alſo provided for the other; for whoſo is not prepared for Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, can never be provided for it; becauſe after Death no Work is to be done, no Proviſion can be made. And finally, Inaſmuch as whoſoever goes out of this World in an eſtate well provided for Death and Judgment, ſhall moſt certainly <hi>reſt from their Labours, their Works following them,</hi> Rev. 14. 13. receive at the laſt day that happy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed Children of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world, Matt.</hi> 25. 34. Therefore whoſoever is prepared for Death and Judgment, is alſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40522:13"/> 
                  <hi>ready for Heaven.</hi> So that all theſe Queſtions are moſt evidently in effect one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Notwithſtanding the Caſe of Conſcience as above put (and 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as weighty a Caſe of Conſcienoe as well can be put) does really contain in it two Queſtions. Firſt, <hi>What ſhould a man do to prepare himſelf for Death?</hi> Secondly, <hi>What to maintain ſuch prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Temper?</hi> And accordingly muſt in the proceſs of this Diſcourſe receive in Juſtice a double Anſwer: For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, many People may have been in ſome part of their days, for a while, both in their own ſenſe, and in reality, tolerably prepared for Death, who yet through ſundry intanglements in the World, and the general deceitfulneſs of Sin, may either totally or very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly relapſe from this ſtate; ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly without doubt, as that, though they may not perhaps, through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Mercy of God to them, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſs of eternal Salvation, yet ſhall they forfeit all Comfort in a dying hour, and go out of this World, both in their own and others apprehenſions, as if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40522:13"/> bound over and conſigned to everlaſting Torments; a moſt dreadful degree of Miſery this moſt certainly! Which Conſideration ſhould awaken all good People always to maintain, as well as at firſt endeavour to attain ſuch a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtate as we are at preſent about to conſult of.</p>
               <p>§. 3. In the mean time, <hi>both theſe</hi> being <hi>Queſtions,</hi> whereto a full and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Reſolution is one of the moſt <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> things imaginable, to People of whatſoever Rank, Sex or Age aſſignable, a man would wonder, that <hi>neither our Lord Jeſus</hi> himſelf, <hi>nor any of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> have any where, (or in any one place of Holy Scripture) profeſſedly and expreſly delivered <hi>an entire and cloſe Anſwer</hi> thereto; nay, that we find not ſo much as either of the Queſtions once directly and plainly put either to our Lord, or the Apoſtles, in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of their Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Indeed we have a Queſtion which <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively</hi> may ſeem at firſt <hi>the ſame,</hi> or ſomewhat <hi>near it,</hi> put by ſome relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons, who were in a way to their Converſion (or as one may ſay, under
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40522:14"/> the pangs of the New Birth) <hi>Acts 2. 37. Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> And yet more nearly by the penitent Jailor, <hi>Acts 16. 30. Sirs, what must I do to be ſaved?</hi> But in both theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the Perſons who make the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, expreſs no reſpect to Death or Judgment, nor ſeem at that time to have had immediately an eye on either: Thoſe in the firſt Inſtance, being at that time by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon only under the firſt conviction of their Sin in cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord of Life, ſeem meerly to have deſigned by their Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall we do to get this ſo great Sin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned?</hi> And in the ſecond Inſtance the poor Jailor having ſeen a Truth, which the Devil ſpoke againſt his Will, <hi>(That the Apoſtles were the Servants of the most high God, and ſhewed Men the way of Salvation,</hi> (v. 17.) Confirmed by a Miracle from Heaven, <hi>(v.</hi> 26.) Intended certainly by that his Queſtion, as he expreſſes it plainly enough, <hi>What muſt I do to obtain</hi> that Salvation you preach? As did alſo that Ruler, <hi>Matth. 19. 16. Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal Life?</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40522:14"/> But none of theſe Queſtions, I ſay pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily or directly proceed upon prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Death, or expreſs any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reſpect thereto. Rather do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr an apprehenſion in the Propoſers of them, that they had a great part of their days then to come, and that they had not an aim at, or looked not in thoſe Queſtions to their Death, but at, and to the whole remainder of their Life (at that time) before them; ſo that I may confidently ſay, theſe two Queſtions named, are no where in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly put; nor therefore in any one place, altogether or intirely and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Reaſon</hi> of their <hi>not being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> we may take to have been their <hi>not being put;</hi> But as to the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of their <hi>not being put,</hi> it is not eaſie to aſſign a better, than that perhaps <hi>the Conceit of Peoples being able in a few days,</hi> or (as ſome poor miſtaken Wretches are apt to imagine) by a few hours Pains and Devotions, <hi>to prepare themſelves for Death,</hi> and their appearance before the Seat of God's dreadful Judgment, <hi>had not yet entred into the world,</hi> or ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40522:15"/> ſeized and poſſeſſed mens minds, as now (God knows, and we poor Miniſters find) it has. This may be one probable cauſe indeed, for which we may conceive this Queſtion no where in Scripture to have been put.</p>
               <p>And that our Lord Jeſus and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſhould not of their own accord ſtart it, there is no wonder: For they well knowing and conſidering, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for Death and Judgment needs to be the Work of a whole Life, and not of ſome ſmall part, or of the Fagg-end of it, (as we may ſo ſpeak) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo far give occaſion to ſuch a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as profeſſedly and cloſely to put together all that is neceſſary to be ſaid to ſuch a Queſtion; but having in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms</hi> firſt <hi>deſcribed the Duty,</hi> they <hi>enjoyned its performance,</hi> and laſtly <hi>ſhewn the danger of its neglect,</hi> they <hi>left the Particulars</hi> of the Preparation required in a ſort <hi>ſcattered through the whole Scriptures;</hi> as indeed the Duty it ſelf, in its full Latitude or Compaſs, runs through all the Parts and Duties of our Lives.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40522:15"/>
               <p>§. 4. In general, I ſay there are Terms which deſcribe, expreſs, or amply ſet forth to us the Duty of Preparation for Death and Judgment: There are many <hi>Commands,</hi> which directly enjoin, and ſuch <hi>Warnings</hi> given of the danger of neglecting it, as lay it moſt intimately home upon all Peoples Conſciences. Our Lord and his Apoſtles ſeldom or never treat of his <hi>coming to Judgment,</hi> but ſtill the Application, as we may call it, (or the practical part of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) is of this nature. Thus, in the Whole four and five and twentieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, and in the parallel places of all the other Goſpels; in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> chap. 5. 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Second Epiſtle, <hi>ch. 3. 14, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Rev. 3. 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> Chap. 16. 15. In all theſe, and other Places, the Chriſtian World is taught, That <hi>the coming of our Lord will be as of a Thief in the night</hi> (and truly it is ſo very oft by Death, as well as to Judgment) <hi>unawares,</hi> upon men <hi>when they look not for him;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all are called upon, and conjured to be <hi>always ready;—To watch;—</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40522:16"/> 
                  <hi>As faithful and wiſe Servants, to be ſtill doing their Lord's Work;—To keep Oil in their Veſſels with their Lamps;—To trim their Lamps;—To have their Loins girded about, and their Lights burning, and to be as them that look for their Lord;—To take heed to themſelves, lest at any time their hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting or Drunkenneſs;</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, even with the nauſeous Qualms of a full Stomach, or of the Night's Intemperance,] <hi>or with the Cares of this world;—To be as Children of the Light;—Not to ſleep,</hi> (that is, not to be idle, not to be ſecure, flattering themſelves in any Sin, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Guilt to reſt upon their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) <hi>as do others; but to watch unto Prayer;—To be ſober, to be vigilant;—To be diligent, that we may be found of him in peace, without ſpot or blemiſh;—To ſtrengthen the things that are ready to die</hi> (that is, quicken, exerciſe, and by exerciſing ripen and confirm <hi>(ſtir up) the Grace of God in us;)—To hold fast till our Lord come;—To keep our Garments,</hi> leſt we be found naked, (that is, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40522:16"/> we maintain a ſanctified and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eſtate, the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which is of God through Chriſt.) All theſe and ſundry like Expreſſions both declare and preſs the Duty, and awaken Conſcience thereto; but ſtill, either <hi>in general</hi> or in <hi>figurative</hi> Terms; and theſe alſo, as beforeſaid, <hi>diſperſed</hi> and in diſtant places.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>The Deſign</hi> therefore <hi>of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> is to lay them all together, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them into as eaſie and natural an Order as may be, and repreſenting or offering them in the plaineſt, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the moſt effectual manner we can; that ſo no ſort of people, who ſhall read, or hear read this poor, plain, practical Diſcourſe, may be ignorant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Matter or Obligation of their whole Duty in this great and moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Caſe.</p>
               <p>And for the better comprehending the whole body of Directions to be given, which muſt have compaſs enough to anſwer the Conditions of people of all ſorts, or of each age, they may moſt fitly be <hi>divided</hi> by the <hi>ſeveral Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which by courſe of Nature, people
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40522:17"/> may conceive themſelves to ſtand in <hi>from Death;</hi> and ſo into three Claſſes or Stages, according to thoſe Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: The <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall be of thoſe, who by courſe of Nature are at the longeſt diſtance, and who therefore now are perfectly to begin their Preparations: A Foundation muſt be laid, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared State attained. The <hi>ſecond</hi> of the middle Stage, the Foundation muſt be ſecured, and a prepared State main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: And the <hi>third,</hi> neareſt our End. For through the Vanity, and Self-flattery which attends all Men in this Life, at leaſt while Death is at any tolerable diſtance, (Men being apt to think they have time enough before them,) divers deſects there will be in all, even the moſt prepared Chriſtians, when nearly approaching their End.</p>
               <p>And theſe, perhaps, we ſhall moſt clearly ſee, when Death being to us, as it were, above the Horizon, and in ſight, diſpels thoſe Miſts, under which we have formerly lain, and frees our Judgments from that partiality, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h which formerly we uſed to paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of things and perſons, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40522:17"/> eſpecially of our ſelves, our own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Intereſts.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The Practice then of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt not end, but with our Lives; and it will be likely to ſucceed the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it begin from the very preſent moment we read, or are warned of our concernment, becauſe none, who are capable to underſtand the Duty, can be too young for the practice of it.</p>
               <p>They who would be ever ready to die, and appear (as they muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably) at the Bar of Heaven, had need to <hi>remember their Creator in the days of their Youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh in which they ſhall ſay, they have no pleaſure in them, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 1. They will have little heart to work, when they have little heart to live; when they would perhaps <hi>be glad,</hi> if poſſible (but poor Creatures! that is impoſſible) <hi>not to be,</hi> to be nothing; which is the Caſe of all unprepared and impenitent men at death.</p>
               <p>But alas! Few of us have been ſo careful to begin as ſoon as it would have concerned us. Thoſe are like to <hi>be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt who began ſooneſt.</hi> As to ſuch who

               <p>§. 1. TO enter then upon our firſt Stage, namely, An Account of ſuch Particulars in order to being prepared for Death, which concern thoſe who are <hi>quite to begin</hi> this Work.</p>
               <p>Of theſe, we may reckon <hi>two ſorts.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Licentious, looſe, ungodly People,</hi> be they young or old; who if they have thought at any time of Death, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or another World, it has been in a ſort againſt their wills; at leaſt they have generally thruſt ſuch thoughts out of their Minds, and <hi>put far from them the evil day,</hi> ſo that Repentance, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God, and all good Conſcience are ſtrangers to them: Theſe People ſometimes Judgment overtakes in this Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are likely to be carried
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40522:22"/> off by Accidents, by violent means, or perhaps by the Hand of Juſtice, and then in a great deal of confuſion of Mind, they think of preparing for Death. A ſecond ſort there are, <hi>more orderly perſons,</hi> who live at the common rate of People amongſt us, <hi>profeſſing</hi> their <hi>Country Religion,</hi> but <hi>in good earnest minding little</hi> of any Religion to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They perhaps ſometimes at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or by hearing or reading Holy Scriptures, or good Books, have been prick'd in Conſcience, and thought of repenting, and in ſuch moods have prayed to God to forgive their Sins, and reſolved to lead new Lives, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Cares of this world, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of Riches, and the Luſts of other things,</hi> Mark 4. 19. entring, and ſeizing their hearts, have daſh'd thoſe beginnings, and blaſted any farther ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Grace; and although there may be ſome knowledge and ſenſe of Duty remaining in them to work upon, yet they are perſectly to begin all through Repentance, and ſo all Preparation for Death. Now even theſe, as well as the former, though haply they may not as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40522:23"/> the others, come under the Laſh of the Law to die by publick Juſtice, yet are with them and all men <hi>obnoxious to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical,</hi> or <hi>Acute Diſeaſes,</hi> Plague, Fevers, Fluxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to <hi>VVars,</hi> and ſuch <hi>overflowing Scourges,</hi> which ſometimes ſweep away the greateſt part of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to <hi>private Accidents,</hi> ſuch as Falls, Bruiſes, breaking of Bones, Wounds, loſs of Blood, and a hundred like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, by which they may ſuddenly be brought to the Gates, or into the Chambers of Death; and, in theſe and like Caſes, it will be neceſſary for them to begin and make up what <hi>preſent prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> they can for Death, and that as <hi>ſpeedily</hi> as may be. If they ſurvive their danger, they may mend or ripen their Preparations; if they do not, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, What can be done on a ſudden, or in a ſew Months, or Weeks, to put ſuch People in a likelihood <hi>of Salvation,</hi> that is, in a ſtate any ways tolerably prepared ſor Death and Judgment? I ſaid, <hi>in a few Months or VVeeks;</hi> for as to a preparation to be made in a <hi>few Days</hi> (God knows, ſome poor People think of a few <hi>Hours)</hi> I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40522:23"/> to any Methods or Directions touching ſuch a Preparation; the thing is, if not impoſſible, yet not ordinarily to be effected. Now theſe Perſons, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many of them, according to courſe of Nature, may be at a long diſtance from the Grave; yet ſith they know not how ſoon they may drop or be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither, it is the Intereſt and Duty of them, and of all, to make up the beſt preparation for Death they can even for the preſent, leſt they ſhould be ſurprized and taken totally unprepared. Nor will this part be only uſefull to ſuch; for, though all may not be perfectly to begin, yet the <hi>Counſels</hi> to be given to <hi>Beginners,</hi> may <hi>ſupply ſome Defects</hi> in <hi>riper years</hi> of common Rank. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Death once, and the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the time when (how ſoon, or by what means) makes as inſtant, ſudden, and perfect preparation for Death as may be neceſſary even to all whatſoever. Never will any wiſe man think he can begin his Preparations too ſoon, and make them too perfect; nor is there any thing more common than mens bitter lamenting, and (alas!) finding themſelves to have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40522:24"/> all cauſe to lament, that they begun too late, or have been too ſlighty and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in them. But when did we ever ſee or hear any repent, or who can be preſumed ever to have had cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that they were too early, or too mature and careful herein?</p>
               <p>Now that our way may be clear, I think fit to remove one ſtumbling Block.</p>
               <p>§. 2. It is not impoſſible, but that to ſome Beginners, (who may be grave Perſons, exerciſed in Science and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, more conſiderative, thoughtful, and of more comprehenſive heads, and ſo ſeeing further than others) it is not impoſſible, I ſay, but to ſuch this work at firſt may ſeem <hi>ſo long,</hi> and to conſiſt of ſo <hi>great variety</hi> of <hi>Parts</hi> (ſo many things neceſſary to being duly prepared ſor Death and the Tribunal of an all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God) as that they may think none can be certain he knows, or any that he teaches, all points neceſſary in this caſe. Eſpecially, it having been above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the Preſcriptions or Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proper hereto, are no where in Scripture put all together, but are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40522:24"/> ſcattered almoſt through the Holy Canon: This Suſpicion I have found in ſome. Now for delivering our ſelves from under this Scruple, and for ſatisfying our Minds touching the <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Advices</hi> which ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be given, let us in the beginning <hi>enquire what Death is,</hi> and <hi>what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And then <hi>what ſhould make us any more unwilling</hi> or <hi>loath to die,</hi> than we are at night, when weary, after the Buſineſs of the day, to go to reſt; or, than a Day-Labourer would be in the Evening to receive his Wages, and be diſmiſs'd. Which things when we have ſeen, we ſhall ſoon diſcern what we have to deliver our ſelves from, and what to provide, and conſequently all that can be neceſſary or profitable for us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our condition, to do, in order to an happy end.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, let us endeavour, as intimately as we can, to ſee what Death is; and at a diſtance narrowly look this <hi>Gorgon,</hi> or (to uſe a Scripture-term) <hi>the King of Terrors</hi> in the face, that from henceforth we may be able calmly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40522:25"/> to think of him, and live prepared to encounter him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> of old generally looked upon <hi>Death</hi> as a <hi>Deſtruction of the whole Man,</hi> and conceived the Soul either in the ſame inſtant with the Body to die, or at leaſt, in ſome time to be diſſipated and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. And even thoſe of them who taught the <hi>Immortality of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra enim ut progrediar, quam ut veriſimilia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deam non habeo. <hi>Cic. Tuſc. Qu. l. 1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Soul,</hi> rather held it as the more <hi>probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture</hi> of the two, than as a certain Truth. But the Holy Ghoſt has taught us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans better. <hi>The Dust indeed returns to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it,</hi> Eccl. 12 7. And, <hi>All live unto him,</hi> Luke 20. 38. Nay, not only does the Soul live <hi>on,</hi> when the Body falls, but even the Body it ſelf ſhall at the laſt day, by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hand of God be raiſed again. Both <hi>Dry Bones,</hi> and the very Duſt of Bones <hi>ſhall live again,</hi> Ezek. 37. And <hi>there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the dead, both of the Juſt and of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> Act. 24. 15. Wherefore if theſe things be true, as no Chriſtian queſtions, Death can be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40522:25"/> nothing but a <hi>Temporary Separation of the Soul from the Body.</hi> There may be indeed, and in caſe of natural Deaths commonly there are, ſome foregoing pains, which we commonly call the <hi>Pangs of Death;</hi> but theſe are rather the moſt uneaſie part of Life, than ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents or parts of Death. And when the Paroxiſm (or ſtrength of the Pain) has once conquered Nature, the inſtant of Death is certainly no more painful than it is to fall aſleep. Death puts an end to thoſe Pains, and, at leaſt for the ſake of being rid of them, is to be wiſh'd for rather than dreaded. Beſides, both Death it ſelf and thoſe its Harbingers, or foregoing pains, in ordinary Caſes, are neceſſary and unavoidable to all Men; therefore it is moſt unreaſonable and unworthy of conſidering Perſons to fear them; rather does it become and concern us, to prepare to bear them as Chriſtianity directs, and with as much eaſe, that is, as much patience as we can. So that in truth, upon the whole, it is more <hi>that which is conceived to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Death,</hi> which <hi>makes</hi> people <hi>fear Death,</hi> than its own Nature.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40522:26"/>
               <p>Of its <hi>followers,</hi> the cloſeſt, moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and inſeparable one, is <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Now <hi>that Judgment,</hi> which <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows Death,</hi> is no doubt chiefly, if not only, the determining and <hi>aſcertaining each dying perſons future Condition:</hi> Whatſoever the Dreadful Pomp and Appearance of our Lord's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Coming, and the Conſlagration of the World has in it, that is not to take place till the laſt day: and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it has been ſcarce ever found, that dying perſons have been appall'd, or diſmay'd, at the apprehenſions of that. So that, as before ſaid, that which muſt make Men afraid, or unwilling to die, muſt be ſomething which is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, attended to or in Men's eye, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following Death.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Now the Summ of all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Conſequents of Death, muſt either be <hi>Evils to our ſelves,</hi> or <hi>to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> ſome way <hi>related to,</hi> or depending on us. And the Evils which can beſall us, muſt affect either our <hi>perſons</hi> in the other World; of which Nature can be nothing but either <hi>Loſs,</hi> or <hi>Pain;</hi> or our <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Memories,</hi> which may ſurvive
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40522:26"/> us in this World. And in caſe we be afraid or unfit to die, ſome or more of theſe we ſhall find and confeſs if we will be true to our ſelves, to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Reaſons. Either firſt we apprehend by Death we ſhall <hi>loſe</hi> ſome Happineſs, we are here poſſeſs'd and perhaps too fond of; or we fear by Death ſome Evil, we are yet free from; or laſtly, we have <hi>ſome Obligations</hi> or Ties upon us to ſome things or perſons in this World, which we would not have yet looſed, or from which we cannot with Honour yet get free. We are entangled with this World, either in affection, or beſides, in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (of our own or others) from which we judge it highly inconvenient for us yet to be diſmiſs'd.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider each of theſe. As to the firſt: <hi>Perfect Happineſs</hi> is all we can wiſh: But Perfect Happineſs no Man can ſay he is, or can be poſſeſt of on Earth; only he has here ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, which he ſanſies to be pretty Good, or little inſlances of Happineſs, and he is in hopes ſometimes of ſome more; now theſe Death will bereave him of: But if a Man could obtain a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40522:27"/> perfect Happineſs <hi>by, or after Death,</hi> it were reaſonable to deſire the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; for then he would have all he could wiſh, and by Death become Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Now this we muſt find a way to do, if we will ſufficiently prepare a Man for Death. Again, as to the ſtate of Men in the other world, there never was, nor is, nor can be any thing ever thought of terrible after Death but <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment of thoſe Sins</hi> which we have committed in this life, or (ſo ſpeak more properly perhaps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of ſome) the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of mind, which theſe Sins have brought upon us, being heightened and continued. But it is plain, many puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Sins, many diſorders and inquietudes thence, we meet with, and ſhall lie under here, more or leſs, as long as we live. If therefore <hi>by, or after Death,</hi> we can be ſecure of a <hi>perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from all theſe puniſhments,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of all poſſible diſorders and evils, we ſhould by ſuch ſecurity be provided againſt all we could fear by, or after Death. Now this alſo is to be done. There remains therefore nothing now
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40522:27"/> to render a Man ready as well as willing to die, but <hi>diſentangling</hi> himſelf from this World.</p>
               <p>§. 5. So that in ſumm, we have <hi>three Intentions</hi> before us, to which all the Advices (at leaſt in this Period) to be given, are to be directed: and if theſe three be by any means attained, there is no queſtion but ſuch perſons who have attained them are prepared for Death. For more evils or inconveniencies by Death, than thoſe mentioned, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive of; and therefore means ſufficient to remove theſe, muſt be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prepare us for Death. And let a Man ſtand never ſo near the top of the Hill, how large a proſpect ſoever he has to the Gulph he is to paſs, he will find himſelf highly concerned, as to theſe three general Intentions.</p>
               <p>Firſt he is to <hi>provide himſelf a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to go to in the other World.</hi> For a Man cannot be in any meaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to part hence, who has no ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of, nor can promiſe to himſelf, any good to be enjoyed hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He muſt <hi>provide against whatever he can fear in another World.</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40522:28"/> For a Man cannot be happy where his Fears remain. And in the former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular we have admitted, He who is prepared for Death muſt be provided of Happineſs in the other World; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo provided againſt what he may fear there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is to <hi>diſentangle himſelf from this World,</hi> and all ſecular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, that he may be able eaſily to part hence whenſoever the appointed hour ſhall come. For it is certainly a great miſery to be torn hence, inſtead of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and willingly yielding up all.</p>
               <p>Theſe three Intentions whoſo has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is as well provided ſor Death, as at a diſtance a Man can be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be; nor is it eaſie to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, at leaſt I muſt confeſs I do not ſee, what can be in thoſe of this Order requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more. But for attaining theſe, there are ſundry Counſels to be taken, and much Work to be done.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And firſt, above all things, ſuch perſons are to <hi>bend their minds to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in good Earnest,</hi> and really to <hi>make that their Buſineſs.</hi> Religion, of all Doctrines in the World, alone can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40522:28"/> to bring a Man to the knowledge of his true Happineſs. And of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions none does that, but the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Our Lord Jeſus has pronounc'd it, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Light;</hi> that is, I alone have effectually brought to Light the true way to Life, <hi>2 Tim. 1. 10. He hath aboliſhed Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to Light through the Goſpel.</hi> Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art that wouldſt provide to thy ſelf a Happineſs in another World, (which indeed is the only true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all elſe is but Spectres, meer Ghoſts and Apparitions of Happineſs) reſolve on being Religious in good Earneſt, and give thy mind thereto.</p>
               <p>§. 7. This the <hi>generality,</hi> even of them which <hi>profeſs Religion, do not do.</hi> Religion, God help us, is taken up by moſt of us as other Faſhions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are, meerly of courſe, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the multitude; and if Men perform ſome outward Exerciſes thereof (in the mean time not living very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly bad) they are look'd upon by their Neighbours as Religious Men. And as long as they do not believe contrary to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40522:29"/> the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, but look upon them as things which perhaps may be true, and have been taken for Truths never doubted of time out of mind, they themſelves eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have a very tolerable Faith; and then, a few cuſtomary Formalities ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, will eaſily paſs, in their ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Judgment of themſelves, for a Chriſtian Practice. And thus, alas, we have many a current Chriſtian without real Chriſtianity; a religious Multitude without a grain of true Religion. For Chriſtianity, or <hi>True Religion,</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>changed heart</hi> and a <hi>changed life:</hi> But the generality of people riſe not hereto; much leſs contents them. As to the getting into their hearts a ſolid and rational Perſuaſion of the being of a God, and of a World to come; as to affecting themſelves with a ſenſe of Sin, and putting themſelves into a ſtate of Pardon through the Blood of Chriſt, and then ſettling and maintaining in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Love and Fear of God, Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Endeavours of Juſtice, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Purity and Humility; and finally keeping to this Temper; theſe are things,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40522:29"/> which either they never thought of, or have put off the concerning themſelves with them, till they have done what they account the buſineſs of Life, that is gotten a fair Eſtate, and in the end of their days may, as they hope, time enough have leiſure and eaſe to conſider of theſe Matters, and ſettle them to their hearts deſire. This, as far as can be judged by ordinary Fruits, is the ſtate and pitch of Religion with the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: Nay there are many, touching whom it is a high degree of Charity to think even thus much. Now he who will be prepared for Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt be religious at another rate.</p>
               <p>§. 8. He muſt, firſt, look upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not meerly as a thing <hi>probable,</hi> or which perhaps may be ſo as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, a <hi>poſſible Truth;</hi> but as indeed it is, <hi>actually the greateſt Truth,</hi> and <hi>Matter of moſt preſſing Concernment</hi> in the World. Whether this Imployment, Trade and Way of Life, or whether that, be the ſureſt and ſpeedieſt Method for me to get an Eſtate, is uncertain: They are both probable, and perhaps
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40522:30"/> there may be a third or fourth way as probable. And whether I ever be rich or no, the Matter is not of the greateſt moment. <hi>Man's Life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he doth poſſeſs;</hi> many Men live happily, who have but from hand to mouth. But whether I be ſaved or damned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be everlaſtingly bleſſed, or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly tormented with the Devil and his Angels; this is a Matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment indeed. And then, that <hi>there is not Salvation in any other,</hi> but in the Crucified Jeſus, nor <hi>any other name given under Heaven amongst men whereby we must be ſaved.</hi> (No Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs to be had but by true Religion) is a thing moſt certainly true; and 'tis moſt vain to think of any other courſe, but this which the Goſpel has laid down.</p>
               <p>Now, to the end that a Man may be truly convinced of thus much, he muſt give his mind, <hi>first,</hi> to <hi>underſtand the Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion</hi> (that is, in plain Terms, the Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith) he muſt read, if he be able, honeſt and eaſie Expoſitions of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40522:30"/> them, having before treaſured up in his memory the Articles of Belief, and Rules of Life; and if he be not able to read, he muſt diligently hear, enquire particularly, of his Miniſter and Friends, touching any thing he underſtands not, which he conceives neceſſary to Salvation: He muſt not reſt, till he has ſatisfied himſelf in ſome plain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Conception of that whereof he is ignorant.</p>
               <p>This being done, in the next place he muſt <hi>attend unto the Reaſons and Evidences,</hi> which there are of the <hi>Truth of ſuch Doctrines.</hi> Why ſhould I believe there is a God, and he Almighty, and the Maker of all things ſeen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen? My Reaſon (if I will but take the pains to think) tells me it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſo. For no Man, nor all Men together, could ever make this World, the viſible Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon and Stars, and put them all into that orderly motion, in which they circle, riſing, moving, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then hidden to us, but enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening and chearing others. Nor can any ſtop the Heavens from moving, nor
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40522:31"/> ſtir the Earth, or make it bring forth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than in ſeaſon. All the Powers we know cannot alter Spring or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, Summer or Winter: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make the Sun riſe ſooner, or ſet la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thereſore ſome <hi>Being</hi> of greater, and indeed <hi>of infinite Power,</hi> there muſt be; that is, the <hi>Almighty God must have made, and doth uphold and govern Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and all therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> gives Account and <hi>farther Proof</hi> of all theſe things. There I read, or thence I may hear the whole <hi>Hiſtory of the Creation;</hi> how all and every of theſe things were made, and how they have been governed ever ſince, and what God made them for, and what he will do with them: Theſe, and the like Evidences of the Truths of Religion muſt ſuch perſon ſearch into; and when he has got any degree of ſatisfaction, carefully treaſure up in his Mind (or Memory) what gave him that ſatisfaction, that he may be able to have recourſe thereto at any time to re-inforce Aſſent, and by virtue of what he believes, to ſatisfie and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40522:31"/> himſelf of other Truths, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of which he yet wants.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>being perſwaded</hi> of the ſeveral Particulars of Religion, it remains ſuch Perſon go on <hi>conſcientiouſly to practiſe</hi> what he knows and believes. Having learn'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinc'd, that there is a God, who made, upholds and governs the World, he will ſoon believe that <hi>this God,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governors, <hi>has given</hi> to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>a Law,</hi> and that what we call the Decalogue, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Ten Commandments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as expounded and improved by our Saviour, is that Law; and that thereby, as our ſame Lord has taught us, all Men ſhall be judged. Upon this, ſuppoſing ſuch cordial Belief of all has been directed unto, it will follow through the Grace of God, that the man will <hi>live in the fear of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Temptations, break himſelf of evil Cuſtoms,</hi> &amp;c. as one who ſhall be judged by this moſt Spiritual Law.</p>
               <p>And that he may ſo do, as taught, he will daily, and earneſtly (with all his heart) <hi>pray</hi> to God; he will ſeriouſly, with real devotion and care, uſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40522:32"/> Means, <hi>attend Sacraments, wait on the Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>apply</hi> all he learns for his advance in Grace, and daily <hi>watching</hi> over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>endeavour to grow better and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Summarily, and in plain terms, this is, I ſay, <hi>being in good earneſt, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Religion,</hi> for People to <hi>give their hearts</hi> to the <hi>underſtanding, believing, and practiſing</hi> the Chriſtian Doctrine and Precepts, and to <hi>perſeverance and growth</hi> in ſuch Practice: Or, more brieſly, as ſaid, to <hi>ſtudy conſtantly to be every day wiſer and better God-wards.</hi> And thoſe who really will not ſet themſelves thus to do, muſt never think of being provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for another World. Nothing will ſit a man for that without ſuch general Religious Care.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Now to bring men thus to give their minds in good earneſt to Religion, I can think of no other, at leaſt no ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or properer way than to deſire and conjure all ſorts of People to accuſtom themſelves to <hi>retire within themſelves,</hi> and <hi>think that they have Souls,</hi> or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen part. It is moſt certain the greateſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40522:32"/> number of Mankind periſh for want of conſideration, and not <hi>exerciſing</hi> of thoſe Faculties they have above Brutes. By our <hi>Bodies,</hi> we are Fleſh and Blood, <hi>equal</hi> in a ſort to <hi>the Beaſts that periſh;</hi> by our <hi>Souls,</hi> we are a part of the unſeen, and indeed of the inviſible World; we are Minds, or Underſtanding, reaſoning Beings, <hi>nearly equalled to Angels,</hi> either good or bad ones. Now the <hi>Bane of moſt People is,</hi> that the Brute, or <hi>Beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part alone lives,</hi> acts and governs; but the <hi>Angel-part,</hi> as it were, <hi>ſleeps,</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, drown'd, or buried. And in the degree that this befalls men, they are more or leſs defective in Religion. Some men, who altogether follow their fleſhly Deſires, have no Religion at all; others, who govern them according to Rules of Civility, have perhaps the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mode (or Faſhion) of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Religion: So that to bring men, I ſay, to be in good earneſt, and ſerious in Religion, I know nothing more likely to be effectual than perſwading them to think, to converſe more with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by <hi>uſing their Minds</hi> to bring themſelves to <hi>feel that they have them,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:40522:33"/> that there are in them Souls, or a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, unſeen, active Part. This, if they were well ſenſible of, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as they have an unſeen part, ſo there may be <hi>an unſeen world,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are told there is; and that as this their unſeen part is truly the Man, and the moſt excellent part of them, ſo the unſeen world is the moſt real, and of greateſt worth and moment. That therefore theſe Souls of theirs ſhould be look'd after, and ſome proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made for them againſt they come to be ſtripp'd of their Bodies, and to paſs naked into the World of Spirits. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by this means they would find, that it is their Bodies that eat, and drink, and ſleep, and are pleaſed and ſatisfied therewith; and that when they have no Bodies, they ſhall do none of theſe: That therefore there muſt be otherguiſe ſatisfaction look'd after for their Souls. In a word, I can hardly believe that a thinking perſon can fail in the End, to arrive at being ſerious in Religion; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he ſet out with any ſober and certain Principles; one Thought will lead on another, till by the Grace of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40522:33"/> God, ſome divine Truth or other pierce or fix in his Heart, and make way for the final Victory of Faith.</p>
               <p>§. 10. We will take a further and more diſtinct inſtance of the Caſe in a <hi>particular Train of Thoughts.</hi> Suppoſe we then a man by himſelf, and either upon the importunity of Miniſters, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rating People into ſeriouſneſs, or upon the inſtigations of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſome way awakened by God's ſecret Grace, (which one time or other is wanting to none under the Goſpel: ſuppoſe we, I ſay, ſuch a perſon) begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to conſider, whether there be any real neceſſity for him to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any further with Religion, than to be in the general faſhion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and having caſt away many things that have been urged upon him, either as falſe, or as uncertain, or of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at length to bethink himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though all the other Particulars uſually inculcated to perſuade me to ſeriouſneſs in Religion, ſhould be falſe, and meerly little Arts and Inventions to awe me; yet this is certain, <hi>die I muſt,</hi> ſooner or later. Not one eſcapes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40522:34"/> this perpetual Law: Thoſe who have thought themſelves moſt exempted from the common Fate of all, have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at length, whether they would believe it or no, felt it, and yielded thereto. Perhaps there may have been ſome, whom we have known or heard of in the World, ſo fond as to ſay, ſuch an one died meerly for want; ſuch a one by fraud; ſuch a one by the neglect or miſtake of his Phyſician; ſuch a one by his own ignorance or wilfulneſs: But I have Wealth enough, that I cannot want what is neceſſary to preſerve me; Knowledge enough timely to diſcover any decay in me, and to prevent its prevalence (or growing too much upon me.) Temper enough to ſecure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my ſelf from many incurable Evils, which others run into; and Caution e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep my ſelf out of Violence or Harm's way, and therefore I ſhall not die: And yet this very perſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we know now to lie in his Grave. We may have obſerved others to fanſie to themſelves a kind of Immortality by piece-meal. This day they think they ſhall not die tomorrow; and when to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40522:34"/> comes, they cannot believe they ſhall die the next day; and when that is come, they are ſtill perſuaded they ſhall ſee another Sun; yet have we ſeen even theſe Men's Sun ſet, and their laſt day come. It is true then, that as thoſe miſtaken, fond ſelf-flatterers have died, ſo muſt I, moſt certainly, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably die.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And, I find (Secondly) by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Multitudes, whom I have ſeen or heard of dying, that it is alſo a great Truth which I have been told, that <hi>Men's Thoughts, when dying, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of Life</hi> (namely touching Wealth, Pleaſures, Mirth, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> nay generally touching all the Actions and States of Men, <hi>prove much different from what they are, in the gaiety and jollity of their days.</hi> Therein indeed they laugh at, and reproach, ſober, devout, and mortified Men; but upon their Death-beds they wiſh themſelves in their Condition. Perhaps while in the way of Gain and Buſineſs, Men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the ſplendor and value of Gold, and think a Bag of it one of the moſt Sovereign Goods in the World. They
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40522:35"/> would venture Credit and Conſcience, and even Life, to come by it. But give Gold to any of thoſe, when dying, and he'll cry out, Why do you torment me? Alas! that has been my Ruine. Oh! that I could have but ſome eaſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience! Oh! that I had but reaſon to hope God would have mercy upon me! Oh! that I had minded Godlineſs as much as I have done Gain! my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition now had been otherwiſe. Thus have we known it with people far (in humane Eſteem) from being irreligious. Yea, take the lewdeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd perſons, whom in their health, nothing but Revelling, and Luſt, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoring and Profaneneſs would down with, who would curſe you for the leaſt good Advice you gave them, or even for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching God to have Mercy upon them: Come to theſe Men, when by God and a Diſeaſe, or by the Magiſtrate and Proceedings at Law, under the Sentence of Death, and have they the ſame ſenſe of their Bottles, and Frolicks, and Minions and mad Company? Will they brave it as formerly? Ask them which of the two you ſhall call to them,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40522:35"/> a pack of merry Boys and Hectors, or a Miniſter, and which will they chuſe? Will Oaths and Damme's, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found me Body and Soul, or even their lewd Songs, or but merry Stories be Muſick now in their ears? Far enough from it; Now nothing but the Prayers of all good people is called for; but too late for the moſt part, God knows. Thus much generally all Men are able to obſerve. And it is a certain Truth, if Men have their Senſes, and are of ſound memory and reaſon, <hi>Conſcience is more awake,</hi> and ſpeaks louder, and more impartially, <hi>when they are in ſight of death than ever.</hi> They that choak'd and oppreſs'd it before, hear and feel it then, whether they will or no. And this I cannot but acknowledge to be a conſtant, at leaſt a general Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, further, Thirdly, <hi>Even at preſent</hi> do I not find within my own Breaſt, and in my calm hours and true ſenſe of things, <hi>a great difference,</hi> as well <hi>between good and evil Actions,</hi> as the <hi>Effects and Products</hi> thereof? Is Money unjuſtly gotten, by Cozenage, or Lying, or Diſſembling (not to ſay
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40522:36"/> worſe) ſo comfortably laid up, as that which is the reward of my honeſt Pains and Induſtry? Or would I be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leave my Son an Eſtate, which I forced as out of the Fire, by Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, grinding the face of the Poor, Falſeneſs, Subornations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as one, which my Anceſtors fairly leſt me, or my own Frugality and honeſt Diligence acquired. And ſo in a thouſand other Caſes, Is not the like difference appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? Is Riot and Roaring, and beaſtly proſtituting my own and others Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſo amiable, and yielding as much eaſe to the mind, as Sobriety, Gravity, and Purity? Nay even in others; Is it as comfortable to me to hear Men lie, and then ſwear to prove their Lies; to hear them curſe and damn, or perhaps but even rail and rant at one another; as to be entertained with grave or wiſe Diſcourſe, or over-hear devout people aſſembled at their Prayers in the Fear of God, and with a decent Concord?</p>
               <p>Further, beſides the inward Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being vertuous and religious, do I not ſee daily, that Men by <hi>Vertue and</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40522:36"/> 
                  <hi>Religion preſerve</hi> themſelves <hi>from a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inconveniencies,</hi> which others run into. They keep (and encreaſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) their Eſtates, their Credit, their Eaſe, their Quiet, their Health, the Love of their Neighbours, and a good Intereſt in their Countrey, with many more Felicities; whereas others by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practices forfeit all: So that a Man cannot but be ſenſible (ſuppoſing him thus to go on thinking and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with himſelf) that Vertue and Religion give Men great advantage of others, not only when going out of the World, but even in the ſtrength and vigor of their age; and that as well in regard of inward Peace, liking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving or being at eaſe with themſelves, as in many worldly reſpects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now <hi>will an outward Demureneſs and Hypocriſie,</hi> a pretending that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Vertue which Men have not, <hi>do all this?</hi> (And truly Profeſſors of Religion, who are not religious in good Earneſt, are no better than demure Hypocrites.) Will I ſay deceiving the World, and perhaps themſelves too, with a pretence to that Integrity that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40522:37"/> they have not, adminiſter Comfort to Men, when dying, or Content and Peace while in Life, at a diſtance from Death? Let me ſeriouſly conſider of this, and there will nothing appear more plain to me, nor ſhall I be more ſenſible of any thing in the World, than that ſuch Temper, as deſcribed, would be a dying Torment to me, a Hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, and that it is really a reproach to me, in my own ſenſe of things at preſent, if I am ſuch; I ſay, if I be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, <hi>my heart</hi> even now <hi>reproaches me</hi> for it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And after all theſe Thoughts, thus in a train and dependance upon one another, run through; after ſuch a thread of Reaſon ſpun by my Soul, <hi>can I believe this Soul of mine is equal to that whereby Beaſts live?</hi> Is it no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, of no longer duration, than the Spirit of a Dog, or of a Swine, or of ſuch vile Creatures? Am I able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, think, and put together all theſe things to no purpoſe? And <hi>have I the ſenſe and proſpect of a Life to come, an earneſt deſire too of Immortality,</hi> and all this <hi>in vain?</hi> Let me ſee; Is it ſo as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40522:37"/> to my other Faculties? Has God given me Eyes to ſee, and yet is there neither Light nor Colours? Has he given me Ears to hear, and are there no ſounds? Has he given me a Mouth, and Palate, and provided a Stomach for reception of Meat, and put an Appetite into it, and parts and powers for digeſting my Meat, yet are there no kinds of Food? Nothing fit to be taſted, eaten dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted? Has he given me a Tongue to ſpeak, and an Underſtanding to frame Thoughts, and direct that Tongue to utter them, and are there no people in the World for me to converſe with? It is plain to me that <hi>none of my other Faculties are in vain:</hi> Therefore, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was I endued with the <hi>Apprehenſion, Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Appetite after another Life in vain,</hi> but another Life after this there is. My Conceptions and Deſires of Immortality were no more put into me in vain, than my Senſes, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Appetites. That is, there is an Immortal State; that is, my Soul is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, or capable of Immortality. We ſee now whither we are come meerly by a little thinking.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40522:38"/>
               <p>§. II. Let us then put all this toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſee what will be the Reſult: Whether it be tolerable or no, to be as vain and formal, and as meer Actors in Religion, as the World of Profeſſors of it are? Or whether we are not moſt highly concerned to be herein, more than in any other practices in the World, or in any other part of Life, moſt ſincere, ſerious and in good Earneſt. The Summ is;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I muſt die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though I <hi>choak</hi> and <hi>oppreſs Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and put tricks upon my ſelf to gloſs over foul Actions at preſent, <hi>I ſhall not be able</hi> to do ſo long, at leaſt not <hi>at Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay even now <hi>at preſent I have much ado to make many things palatable,</hi> which yet in practice I ſwallow; ſo that I muſt account that <hi>at my Death,</hi> if I am then in my Senſes, <hi>they'll ſting me</hi> with a witneſs, and in all probability not only in my departing, but <hi>eternally</hi> in that Immortal State.</p>
               <p>For <hi>I cannot perſuade my ſelf but there is a Life after this:</hi> I have ſo many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of it within my ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40522:38"/>
               <p>And <hi>it is not an outſide Demureneſs,</hi> or ſhadow of Religion, which <hi>will bear me out, or ſtand me in stead at Death and Judgment.</hi> Then the Vizor will fall off. Therefore it is my Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above all things, to be early ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Religion. For I am ſenſible none die comfortably but vertuous Men: None elſe, when dying, have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>eaſe, as to what is paſt,</hi> or a <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proſpect of what is to come.</hi> So that the Concluſion of all is, If I will follow what in my own ſenſe of things (and herein all good and wiſe Men, all that are not beſide themſelves, mad or vicious, agree with me) I muſt ſet my ſelf to be ſerious in, and moſt intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion. And this is the firſt ſtep of Preparation for Death and Judgment in our Stage.</p>
               <p>The Second will be, That we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately go upon the <hi>reconciling our ſelves to God,</hi> and endeavour to make our Peace with him; of which in the next Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>BEing retired ſeriouſly; Firſt,</hi> Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Conſcience, <hi>How thou hast ſtood affected and concerned hitherto in Matter of Religion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Haſt thou concerned thy ſelf any more in it, <hi>or about it,</hi> than in other Cuſtoms <hi>and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of thy Countrey?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In caſe thou haſt, with more outward Concernment than the generality of people, eſpouſed the Profeſſion of Religion, yet as to the</hi> Vertue it ſelf, <hi>Religion in the Soul;</hi> (1.) Is thy heart furniſhed with ſound Knowledge? <hi>Hast thou reaſonable Conceptions of the Doctrine and Precepts of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: And,</hi> (2.) Art thou ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in thy heart perſuaded that Chriſtian Religion is true, <hi>and</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40522:39"/> 
                     <hi>the</hi> alone ſure way to Happineſs? <hi>Or elſe on the contrary, Art thou a meer, formal, external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, pretending to be zealous in this or that way; but deſigning by ſuch pretence only other ends, than thoſe of thy Soul in an unſeen World. Conſider the Matter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly: For a multitude of meer worldly Bigots (of zealous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſors) are there in our World, who both with themſelves and others paſs for religious Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or, 3. Though thou haſt been through the Grace of God enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and art in ſome meaſure knowing and perſwaded in thy Conſcience, of the Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; yet is it not thy Caſe (as it is many other religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's) that</hi> thou art, <hi>as to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> really lukewarm, in love with the World and things that are ſeen? <hi>So that thou haſt been very</hi> negligent in an holy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, conſcientious Practice; <hi>and, by reaſon of this Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, can'ſt ſcarce ſay, thou hast</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, After this Search, if thou findeſt thy <hi>Condition</hi> to be any of theſe <hi>three,</hi> pauſe a while, and <hi>conſider par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the guilt and ſinfulneſs of it,</hi> whichſoever of the three it prove.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Firſt;</hi> ſuppoſing that to be thy Caſe. Thou haſt taken up thy Religion, juſt as thou hast done thy cloths.

In like ſort; all Nations have ſome Religion, Thy Countrey or thy Friends this, and therefore thou art of it. Thou haſt been bred to it as they ſay. Good God! what a monſtrous profane thing is this,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40522:40"/> That one who has the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould make no more matter of Religion, than of the faſhion of a Suit of Cloths!

                  <p>As to the <hi>Second,</hi> To pretend Zeal for God and Heaven, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the driving on a poor, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or carnal Intereſt, when really I neither believe God or Heaven, or care for either, what abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hypocriſie is this? What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Devils (white Devils as the people ſpeak) are ſuch Men?</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Third;</hi> To be perſuaded that there is no true Happineſs but in God; that this World is but a Dream in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that to come; at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that this Life is a ſtate of Trial, according to my behaviour wherein, I am to be everlaſtingly happy or miſerable, and yet to be indifferent and cool in my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and purſuit of heavenly

                     <hi>Thirdly; According to thy Condition, now betake thy ſelf to God by</hi> Prayer; (1.) <hi>Lifting up thine heart to him, and</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him as a God that ſearcheth and knows thee, that poſſeſſeth thy Reins; <hi>and</hi> diſcerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart, <hi>who therefore most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ſees whether thou diſſembleſt or no—That</hi> will be ſanctified of all who draw near unto him, <hi>and has accurſed all Hypocrites and double-hearted Men; who therefore will be content with nothing leſs than all thy heart, and mind, and ſoul.

               </p>
               <p>§. 1. IT was good Counſel, though given by one who had more need himſelf to have taken it, than he to whom he gave it; <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelf with God, and be at Peace, thereby good ſhall come unto thee,</hi> Job 22. 21. And whoſoever is once <hi>ſerious in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as before urged, will very tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel himſelf <hi>concern'd to endeavour ſuch Acquainting himſelf</hi> with God, as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40522:44"/> may be a <hi>Method of Peace with him;</hi> nay, he will not be at eaſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he will ſcarce give Sleep to his Eyes, or Slumber to his Eye-lids, till he has made ſome advance towards God for Mercy, and ſo for Peace. Suppoſing any Man now firſt to grow ſerious, and ſo never yet to have been reconciled to God; the ſenſe of a vaſt load of Guilt will ſoon oppreſs and almoſt ſink his Soul; of no leſs a load than the whole Maſs and Body of all his Omiſſions and Commiſſions ever ſince he came to any memory of his Actions; not one of all pardoned, for not one of all repented of: So that he will be crying out with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 69. 1, 2. <hi>Save me O God, for the waters are come in unto my Soul; I ſink in deep Mire, where there is no ſtanding; I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</hi> This will put him upon inſtant endeavours of Peace and Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Now there is, ſay ſome, a <hi>double Reconciliation</hi> of our ſelves to God; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of the <hi>Perſon</hi> to him, and a Reconciliation of the <hi>Heart and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> a diſtinction, if at all proper,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40522:44"/> yet moſt certainly of ſuch things as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated: For without this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely the Reconciliation of the Mind (at leaſt begun, and in a good meaſure accompliſh'd) the perſon can never be reconciled. For if the Mind can never be ſeparated from the Man, then cannot the perſon be reconciled, except the Mind be ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>But let there be as much in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction as there can; to <hi>effect both</hi> theſe kinds of Reconciliation, we are to ſet out, and proceed the ſame way. The <hi>Practice of Repentance from dead works,</hi> (in its full Latitude) and of <hi>Faith in Christ Jeſus,</hi> effects both.</p>
               <p>§. 3. There are ſcarce any two <hi>Names</hi> in the World more <hi>frequently in the Mouths</hi> of Chriſtians, than theſe two, Repentance and Faith; and there are perhaps <hi>no Duties</hi> of like importance <hi>leſs underſtood:</hi> For both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral places of Scripture uſed in ſeveral, and very different Sences, many plain perſons are confounded in their Notions, or in the underſtanding of them.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40522:45"/>
               <p>To make all then as diſtinct and plain as I am able; The Word <hi>Repent</hi> (or <hi>Repentance)</hi> according to its <hi>proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> in uſual Speech, is no more, than to be <hi>ſorry for ſomething which we have done amiſs;</hi> that is, which we apprehend done to our own or others harm, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or prejudice, ſome way or other, which therefore we from our hearts <hi>wiſh undone,</hi> and <hi>would call back or undo,</hi> were it poſſible for us.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Faith</hi> alſo properly ſignifies only <hi>Belief,</hi> that is <hi>aſſenting</hi> or agreeing to any thing as <hi>true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>full import</hi> of both theſe Words in common Language. But in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and with Divines, though they retain this their general Notion, yet becauſe they are for the moſt part applied, each of them to its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proper Object (as Repentance to <hi>Sin,</hi> called by the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Dead Works)</hi> and Faith to the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> (and ſo to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> its Authors) they receive from thence a determinate and reſtrained ſence, and ſignifie certain <hi>Chriſtian Vertues,</hi> which are <hi>partly Gifts of God,</hi> (that is, wrought
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40522:45"/> in us by his Grace, or by a ſupernatural Power) <hi>partly</hi> alſo <hi>our Duties,</hi> becauſe they are (at leaſt in <hi>the firſt beginnings</hi> of them) ſuch <hi>Acts which God requires of us,</hi> and, by the Means and Aids which he has provided and affords us, has made, and makes, in our powers to exert or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; and (in the <hi>progreſs, growth, or ripeneſs</hi> of them) <hi>Habits</hi> attained by theſe former Acts, to which he by his Grace hath excited and enabled us. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> then, as it is an <hi>Act of Chriſtian Duty,</hi> is an <hi>endeavour of forſaking Sin, and of leading a new Life;</hi> or a <hi>Change of Manners for the better;</hi> it is a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row conſiſting not ſo much in grief, or <hi>tranſient Affection</hi> (though there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that too in it) as of <hi>ſetled Diſſent and Diſlike,</hi> and ſo of <hi>real Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> it is ſetting the Heart againſt Sin, and becauſe it is impoſſible for us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the Ill we have done, <hi>a taking care we ſin no more;</hi> whether by doing what we ought not, or the neglecting what we ought to do; and as it is an <hi>Habit,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> it is a <hi>changed Heart and Life.</hi> For by frequent and conſtant endeavour of a new Life, the very frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40522:46"/> of our Hearts will be changed; and that changed Frame and Temper will have a conſtant influence upon our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo our Life will be changed. Thus as to the nature of Repentance.</p>
               <p>Now, as to <hi>Faith;</hi> The moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Act of Chriſtian Duty</hi> ſo called, is, the Soul's <hi>agreeing or yielding that the Goſpel</hi> (or the way to Heaven, which Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles taught) <hi>is true.</hi> It preſuppoſes therefore the underſtanding of that Doctrine or Way. Now the <hi>particular Acts</hi> of it are as <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> as the <hi>Parts of the Goſpel:</hi> And though, with many People, Uſe hath obtained that a <hi>Belief of the Promiſes,</hi> and (indeed of one part of them, of the promiſed Bleſſing, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to the other part, the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Bleſſing) and ſo a <hi>truſt in God through Chriſt,</hi> is eſteemed the great Act of Faith, yet is the <hi>aſſenting or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to whatſoever is affirmed in the Goſpel;</hi> [as that Chriſt died, roſe again, now ſits in Heaven, ſhall come to judge the World, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> as much (or more properly) an Act of true Chriſtian Faith, as ſuch Truſt or Affiance, which in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40522:46"/> ſtrictneſs, is a diſtinct Chriſtian Vertue, grounded in Faith. In like manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is the <hi>receiving this dreadful Threat,</hi> He that believeth (and ſo repenteth) not, ſhall be damned, <hi>a true Act of Faith,</hi> yet not of Truſt. And to conclude, the <hi>Belief of all the Commands in the Goſpel,</hi> not only that they came from God, are reaſonable, and fit for us to obſerve; but that they are an effectual and certain way to everlaſting happineſs, (ſo that whoſoever yields the obedience of Faith, ſhall be ſaved) is as much an Act (a neceſſary Act) of Chriſtian Faith, as any of the reſt. And the Habit of Faith is nothing elſe but a rooted perſwaſion of all theſe the ſeveral parts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by which the Soul is ready, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offers, to exert any of theſe Acts; Thus as to the Nature of Repentance and Faith, when they ſignifie, or are taken for Chriſtian Vertues or Graces. And yet even when thus taken in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (though they are not always, even in Scripture it ſelf taken for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues; yet, I ſay, when thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) they are each of them uſed in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different extent.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40522:47"/>
               <p>§. 4. Sometimes in a <hi>very ample and large ſence (Synecdochically,</hi> as we ſpeak) are they put not only for themſelves, but what accompanies them. And thus the Scripture ſeems to make one while Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, one while Faith the <hi>whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> or to put one of them for all that we, on our part, are by that Covenant bound to do, in order to our acceptance with God, or to the pardon of our Sin and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus not only when St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and the Apoſtles, but when Chriſt himſelf firſt went out to preach the Kingdom of Heaven, or teach peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the way thither, the Sum of their Doctrine is recorded to have been, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> Mat. 3. 2. and, 4. 17. Mark 6. 12. No doubt both our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached <hi>Faith</hi> as well as <hi>Repentance</hi> all along; and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Goſpel expreſly brings in our Lord ſo preaching, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 14, 15. <hi>Jeſus came preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God, and ſaying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe the Goſpel.</hi> Yet in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40522:47"/> other places, Repentance is put alone, but with an intent, no queſtion, that people ſhould underſtand therewith its neceſſary Concomitant and Companion, Faith. And thus when our Lord inſtructs the Apoſtles in what they were to preach, he tells them, It behooved that he ſhould ſuffer, and riſe again, and that <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Remiſſion of Sin ſhould be preached in his name among all Nations, Luke</hi> ult. 47. And as purſuant hereto, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he preaches to thoſe who were pricked in their heart by the ſenſe of their guilt in crucifying the Lord of Life; (who therefore had as much need of Faith in the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for Remiſſion, as any could have) When he preaches, I ſay, to them what they ſhould do to obtain Pardon, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in expreſs terms only, <hi>Repent, and be Baptized,</hi> Acts 2. 38. and, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 10. to others of the ſame Nation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame guilt, <hi>Repent ye, and be converted:</hi> In this laſt place indeed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is more explained than before, but yet no mention made of Faith in any of theſe places, where yet the Deſign was to ſet down the Condition on which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40522:48"/> Sin might be pardoned, which, as will be ſoon evident, is Faith as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Again, in other places me meet with mention of Faith or believing alone, without any mention of Repentance. Thus in the promiſe annex'd to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Commiſſion for preaching the Goſpel, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth the poor humble Jailor, what he ſhould do to be ſaved, all he gives in Inſtruction is only, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thine Houſe,</hi> Acts 16. 31. Here we ſee believing, or Faith alone, without any mention of Repentance, has Salvation promiſed to it; as if a Man were to do nothing to be ſaved, but believe the Goſpel. Nay, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtles, ſeems to go beyond what is aſſerted in any of theſe places, concluding from due Premiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Therefore a Man is juſtified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law:</hi> That is, without a Jewiſh, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Righteouſneſs. And the ſame
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40522:48"/> he ſays in other places: The Reaſon hereof undoubtedly is, for that ſincere believing the Goſpel, or <hi>Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth moſt certainly involve, or <hi>carry with it Repentance.</hi> He that receives from his heart that Doctrine (or believes that way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,) which our Lord Chriſt taught, will ſeek Heaven by Repentance, or breaking off his Sin: Elſe, it is plain, he believes not what Chriſt preached at the very firſt; <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And if he truly and Chriſtianly repent, it is plain he believes in Chriſt, for he takes that very way to Salvation, to which Faith in Chriſt directs him.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Yet at another time when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks more at large, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and expreſly, both Repentance and Faith are each <hi>(in terminis)</hi> ſet down and mentioned, as diſtinct parts of our Chriſtianity, and ſo of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Pardon and Eternal Life, which the Goſpel propoſeth to us; thus in the Text of St. <hi>Mark</hi> already cited: <hi>Repent ye and believe the Goſpel.</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. St. <hi>Paul</hi> proteſting to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40522:49"/> Elders, that in his preaching he had <hi>kept back nothing that was profitable for them,</hi> reduces the ſumm of all he had ſhewed them, and <hi>taught them either publickly, or from houſe to houſe</hi> (that is the whole way of Salvation) to theſe two Points: He had <hi>teſtified both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> And agreeably hereto, the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> makes <hi>Repentance from dead Works,</hi> and <hi>Faith towards God,</hi> two <hi>Foundations</hi> or <hi>Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 6. 12.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole then, being that all theſe Texts contain the undoubted Words of our Lord himſelf, or of his Apoſtles, or Perſons inſpired by him, for the inſtructing Mankind in the way to Pardon and Salvation, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, either that ſometimes Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ſo put as to compriſe or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in it Faith, and ſometimes again Faith ſo put as to compriſe Repentance; or elſe one of theſe Abſurdities will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Either that, (1.) our Lord Chriſt, and the Apoſtles ſometimes taught an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40522:49"/> inſufficient way to Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, (2.) that there are two or three ways to them, and 'tis no matter which we take. Neither of which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectaries can be ever admitted; at leaſt not by Proteſtants: Wherefore it is not reaſonable to imagine the practice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Repentance or of Faith, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Peace with God, may be ſpared, becauſe in ſome places only one of them is mentioned; for that thoſe places, which make both neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, evidently inforce us where one only is expreſſed there to underſtand the other: And beſides that, we have ſeen the Nature of each of them is ſuch, that they mutually inferr one the other: that is, neither can be without the other.</p>
               <p>This will yet further appear, in the Account now to be given of the due Method of the practice of both, in order to make our Peace with God.</p>
               <p>The Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> ſpoke more like an experienced Chriſtian, than a Jewiſh Apochryphal Author, when he ſaid, <hi>Faith is the beginning of our cleaving unto God,</hi> Eccleſ. 25. 12. for one grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40522:50"/> than he tells us, <hi>He that cometh unto God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. But Repentance is a coming and turning unto God; 'tis a departing from, or putting away what he moſt hates, a wicked heart and life; therefore there can be no practice of it without Faith foregoing.</p>
               <p>And not only without ſuch a Faith foregoing as that now mentioned out of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews, That God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him,</hi> which is only the Faith due by the Law of Nature: (for the Light of Nature will convince us of the Being of a God, and his juſt Government of the World) but even not without moſt of the Acts of Faith truly Chriſtian, will Repentance ever be effected. We have therefore in the firſt place, and before any thing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and conjured, to be ſerious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and in good Earneſt in Religion; and that (as explained) imports the giving a Man's ſelf honeſtly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and by due Evidences to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40522:50"/> himſelf of the truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo that we ſuppoſe him who is to practiſe Repentance, not only to know in general what his Duty is, what Sin is, what the Rewards belonging to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and what the Wrath and Curſe of God belonging to Sin, but to be heartily perſwaded of all theſe, as alſo, of the whole Covenant of Grace, and its Conditions; that God will as ſurely pardon and ſave every repenting and believing Sinner, as he will damn all impenitent &amp; unbelieving wretches. The Belief of this certain Woe, if he go on in Sin, and certain Pardon and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, if he take up, is the foundation and inducement of all true Repentance. Thus a Faith, or a Belief of the Doctrines, Threats, Promiſes, and Commands of the Goſpel, when hearty and real, moves, acts, and ſets on the Soul, at the very firſt, to Repentance; nor is Repentance poſſible without ſuch Chriſtian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or without the hearty perſwaſion of the truth of what we know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, as before ſet forth. Yet over and above all this, we ſhall anon ſee Faith farther concerned, than what has
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40522:51"/> yet been ſaid comes to, in making our Peace, or reconciling us to God.</p>
               <p>§. 6. In the mean while let us take a diſtinct view of the practice of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and do what we can particularly to ſee by <hi>what ſteps or acts</hi> we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a <hi>true penitent ſtate,</hi> that is, a Heart and Life changed from a courſe of Sin, to the honeſt and ſtedfaſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Holineſs: For, no leſs than ſuch a changed Heart and Life does true Repentance (or a penitent ſtate) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. And the Steps are four.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> A particular ſight and ſenſe of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Contrition under it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Confeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Actual breaking off the courſe of Sin, both by the ſtudy of Mortification, and of a Holy and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life. The due practice of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance includes, I ſay, all theſe four.</p>
               <p>He who writes this, is not ignorant a certain Church has made the Practice of Repentance a Sacrament, and calls it by the name of <hi>Penance,</hi> and tells us, thereof there are but three parts; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Confeſſion, and Satisfaction;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40522:51"/> in to which they hedge in Prieſtly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. And theſe indeed, after their way (or common road of Practice) are quickly diſpatch'd. But they have herein diſguiſed the Truth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably corrupted the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of Chriſtian Religion. The whole Truth, which really lies under this Diſguiſe, we will endeavour faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and plainly to repreſent, by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particularly every one of the four forementioned Steps of Practice, which bring to this happy and peaceful ſtate.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And the firſt of them is, <hi>a plain and particular ſight and ſenſe of our own Guilt.</hi> A <hi>ſenſe,</hi> I ſay, as well as <hi>ſight;</hi> and I mean thereby, ſuch a <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> of our being tranſgreſſors of God's Holy Commands, together with ſuch a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi> both of the foulneſs of the Fact or Facts whereby we have tranſgreſs'd, and the danger thereof, that we are as far from excuſing, or thinking ſlightly of the Matter, as from denying it: We ſee our ſelves guilty, vile, and loathſome, and without God's ſpecial Mercy, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly miſerable.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:40522:52"/>
               <p>Some Proteſtant People at preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light rather to call what we are now ſpeaking of, <hi>Conviction,</hi> or (in the Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Number) Convictions of Sin, than to give it the Name we do. And both they and we mean, I conceive, thereby much the ſame with what has been more anciently by others termed (from that Paſſage, as I ſuppoſe, touching thoſe Converts mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37.) <hi>Compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. They were,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>pricked at their hearts;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, compunged, point by point pricked and wounded. The like whereto is alſo recorded of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 10. <hi>David's heart ſmote him after he had numbred the People.</hi> But the Name Conviction of Sin is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of St. <hi>John,</hi> chap. 16. 8. Where we read it to be a promiſed Work of the Holy Ghoſt's, that when he ſhould come into the World, <hi>he ſhould reprove</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) in the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>convince the World of Sin;</hi> wherefore there is no fault at all to be found with that Term, provided it be allowed, that that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin, which leads to Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Repentance, muſt conſiſt in the Sinner's <hi>ſight and ſenſe,</hi> firſt, <hi>of his own</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:40522:52"/> 
                  <hi>particular Guilt;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>of the real Evil of his Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of a ſight of Sin, that is, of our own particular Guilt. We muſt not only ſee in general, that we are Sinners, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the Laws of God at random; but as to this or that kind, and in theſe or theſe inſtances, that we have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt particular Commands. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have been, or are, either Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, or Drunkards, or Revilers, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, or Unjuſt, or Swearers, or Blaſphemers, or Luſtful, and Unclean, or Proud, or Sinners in ſome of theſe, or like kinds, by divers particular Acts, notorious in ſuch or ſuch part, or parts of our Lives. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf; <hi>who was,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and a Perſecuter, and Injurious,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. And in the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place (the Original of this Phraſe, <hi>Conviction of Sin)</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Holy Ghost ſhould convince the world of Sin,</hi> on that peculiar account, <hi>becauſe they believed not on Christ Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this part of the Conviction of Sin is nothing but a <hi>particular accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Conſcience,</hi> which ſometimes God
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40522:53"/> in a great meaſure <hi>prevents</hi> us with, without any endeavours of our own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Miniſtry of his Word,</hi> as in the Caſe of thoſe Converts before ſpoken of, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Sometimes by the <hi>Holy Spirit's ſecret and more immediate quickning or awakening Conſcience;</hi> as in the Caſe of <hi>David,</hi> already alſo mentioned. Or, otherwiſe <hi>by ſome ſurprizing Affliction,</hi> or croſs Providence; as in the Caſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, when they had been apprehended, and kept three days in durance, for being, as was pretended, Spies: <hi>We are,</hi> ſay they, <hi>verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us,</hi> Gen. 42. 21. Or perhaps in <hi>ſome other Methods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for a <hi>full and due ſight of all</hi> the Particulars of ones Guilt, I conceive no perſon can attain to it, without a <hi>ſtrict and long ſcrutiny, ſearch or exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Conſcience;</hi> without very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſiderate enquiry into his Heart, Life and Actions: Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one who would reconcile himſelf to God, muſt upon the firſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40522:53"/> 
                  <hi>pricking or ſmiting of his heart</hi> (in which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of the Methods before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he feel it) immediately ſet upon. For where there is one Sin, undoubtedly there are more: God having therefore graciouſly ſhewn us ſome, we being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened thereby, ſhould ſearch after the reſt. Convictions of Conſcience from God, ſhould put us upon ſtricter ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination. No corner of our Heart (as I may ſo ſay) that is, no part or powers of our Soul ſhould be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch'd. An Enquiry after Sin ſhould be made through all our Deſires, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, Counſels, Buſineſs and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and (if poſſible) through all the Actions and Parts of our Life. So as to have all our Sins, after ſome ſort, in order before us, bare-faced and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other part of Conviction of Sin, is a ſight and ſenſe of the Evil of Sin; that it is not only <hi>foul and odious,</hi> diſagreeable to the true Principles of our Nature (to what in our hearts we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove) and unworthy of the ſence and underſtanding of a Man, making us brutiſh, loathſome in the eyes of God,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40522:54"/> and of all good and wiſe men, and even of our ſelves, when we are truly our ſelves, and judge of things as they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are; but alſo moſt <hi>miſchievous and deſtructive;</hi> that it at firſt brought Death, and all temporal Miſeries into the World; that it brings upon us at preſent the Wrath and Curſe of God, Curſes in our Perſons, Eſtates and Names, Curſes in our Families, Relations, and all our Concerns; Curſes more than we can well comprehend; yet are all theſe preſent Curſes nothing in compariſon of what it will bring upon us without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, a Portion with the Devil and his Angels, <hi>The Wrath to come,</hi> or <hi>the Vengeance of everlaſting Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this part of the Conviction of Sin, is nothing elſe but the <hi>Sentence or Doom of Conſcience</hi> upon the former Convictions. Now with this alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does God prevent us; either by the Miniſtry of the Word, or by ſecret Terrors immediately ſent into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (flaſhing, as it were, Hell-fire in our faces) or by more moderate Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>ſealing inſtructions to our Ears.</hi> The Degrees wherein Holy Men are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40522:54"/> exerciſed herewith, as well have been, as are, and ever will be, very different. But it is ſurely the Duty as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of every one, who would be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and holy, either in Heart or Life to endeavour by a frequent conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well of the real ſhamefulneſs, vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deteſtable Nature of Sin, as of the Dangers thereby preſent and future, to Body and Soul, Perſon and all perſonal Concerns, to poſſeſs their hearts with a deep ſenſe of its Evil. 'Tis as certain as God is true, that <hi>Miſchief will hunt the wicked man to overthrow him,</hi> Pſal. 140. 11. And, <hi>be ſure your Sin will find you out,</hi> Numb. 32. 23. There is no poſſibility of flying from Guilt, except a man could fly from himſelf; nor of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, eſcaping from puniſhment, except it were poſſible to fly from God. Theſe things he ſhould frequently and ſeriouſly think upon, whoſoever would fix in his Heart a ſight and ſenſe of his Sin; the honeſt endeavour whereof is the firſt ſtep to true Repentance.</p>
               <p>§. 8. A Second is <hi>Contrition, Broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart</hi> (ſo named from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17.) or <hi>ſorrowing after a godly ſort,</hi> (as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40522:55"/> the Apoſtle calls it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.) when looking upon our Sin, we really in heart are afflicted for it, and mourn over it. This ordinarily through the Grace of God, follows naturally upon the other, in the converſion of every Sinner; but in caſe we find it either always to have been much wanting, or at preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and loſt (to our ſenſe) in us, there is no ſuch way to beget or raiſe it again, as to endeavour to <hi>heighten the ſight and ſenſe of our own Guilt, and God's infinite Grace and Goodneſs.</hi> To this purpoſe the ſeveral aggravations of our Sins are to be conſidered. We, it may be, from our Cradle to our preſent Age, have all along been in ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that <hi>all our Sins are exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> What Mercies has God continually heaped upon us, and even laden us with? How early were we acquainted with his Will, and made ſenſible of our Duty and Obligations to him? What Aids have we received by Education? What Warnings by Miniſters, by Parents, by Friends? Having even been <hi>hewed by the words of his Meſſengers,</hi> or Agents of all ſorts? What quickning by his Spirit?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40522:55"/> Has not <hi>his Word</hi> (to allude to holy <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s expreſſion) <hi>been in our heart, as a burning fire ſhut up in our Bones?</hi> Yet have we ſuppreſs'd or ſmothered all this warmth, and quenched the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit. Nor Conſcience, nor Grace has prevailed to reſtrain us from Sin; we have trampled on both. We have heard again and again of the <hi>Blood of Jeſus,</hi> ſhed for us, and been preſs'd with our duty thereto; yet in effect, have we <hi>accounted it an unholy thing,</hi> at leaſt, made it to us hitherto very ineffectual, for Baſeneſs or Trifles <hi>denying the Lord that bought us.</hi> And all this <hi>how often? how long?</hi> Are not in a manner all our Sins become habitual to us? A ſecond Nature, by our own very Act? So that <hi>being accuſtomed (Learn'd,</hi> as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Word ſignifies, namely, by our own wicked practice) <hi>to do evil, we can now no more do good than the</hi> Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian <hi>change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots.</hi> Look, look, poor Soul, that canſt not mourn for Sin, look upon thy ſins, what an infinite number or heap is there of them, reaching up to Heaven? And all of them Crimſon ſins too, crying
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40522:56"/> to God in heaven for vengeance upon thee. Look, I ſay as near as thou canſt, on their <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and look till <hi>thine Eyes affect thine Heart,</hi> and thine Heart diſſolve in Tears. This is the readieſt way to produce Contrition, or Godly Sorrow; the Endeavour of which is a ſecond ſtep to Repentance.</p>
               <p>§. 9. A third will be <hi>Confeſſion of Sin,</hi> and indeed without this, eſpecially to God, Contrition will be very faint: Our affections are not ordinarily moved without attent and continued thought; and thought will not well be kept attent without words: When therefore we ſay a ſight and ſenſe of Sin, together with Contrition for it, and Confeſſion of it, are a firſt, ſecond and third ſtep to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, this is not to be ſo taken as if they were disjoyned, ſeparate and practiſed perfectly apart from one another, or any of them without the other; they who would be true penitents muſt (ſeriouſly caſting themſelves before God in ſecret) <hi>Examine, Mourn and Confeſs,</hi> as new matter offers it ſelf; and then Examine again for more matter, and Confeſs and Mourn again. All theſe run into one
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40522:56"/> another, and lead one to the other (as I may ſay) backward and forward: And a Soul by honeſt endeavours of them before God in ſecret, will even by its own experience, and the duct or courſe of its own affections, find the due me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, order and ſavory practice of them, better than words can expreſs, or any Caſuiſt adviſe.</p>
               <p>Now by Confeſſion of Sin we muſt not conceive to be meant <hi>a meer reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Sins,</hi> or rehearſing before God our ſeveral <hi>Acts of Sin,</hi> (which yet God knows to do perfectly is impoſſible for the beſt of us) no nor giving account even of <hi>all the ſeveral kinds</hi> of our Sins (though both theſe are to be done as far as we are able) but a <hi>hearty affectionate charging and accuſing our ſelves before God,</hi> according to what we know, to the very full heighth of our guilt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging together that our Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Self-accuſations come far ſhort of the juſt account or ſumm of our Sins, whereof a vaſt multitude are unknown to us; owning our ſelves therefore to have deſerved eternally the Divine wrath and curſe, and at preſent to lie at God's
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40522:57"/> mercy. Thus at once not only <hi>accuſing</hi> but <hi>condemning,</hi> and as it were paſſing Sentence on our ſelves, and giving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by glory to God, whatever becomes of us. This kind of reflections will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by God's grace bring us to deep remorſe, and humiliation of Soul, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of our ſelves, and admiring the goodneſs of God, who has born with us ſo long, and has never (all this time) taken advantage againſt us, while going on in the affronting his Juſtice, abuſing his Grace, and by all ways provoking him to cut us off in the midſt of our Days as well as midſt of our Sins. And from hence our Confeſſions will lead us inſenſibly into <hi>deprecating</hi> that wrath, which we have owned our ſelves to have deſerved; to the begging mercy and pardon as earneſtly as ever poor Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, when about to receive Sentence, acknowledged what he had before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hide, and caſt himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mercy. Such affectionate work as this, I ſay, is that Confeſſion of Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, which leads to and together ever accompanies Repentance.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:40522:57"/>
               <p>§. 10. Some indeed make Confeſſion (as it is a part of what they call Penance, and in the name of Penance, they would be content we ſhould think they include all Repentance, or rather mean thereby the whole Method of reconciling Men to God) ſome, I ſay, would make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be little (if any thing) elſe, but an unboſoming our ſelves to a Prieſt, diſcovering to him all our moſt ſecret ſins, which either are, or we ſuſpect to be mortal, (as they ſpeak) with their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Circumſtances. But this Uſurpation upon Mens Conſciences, and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls (without any Command in Scripture, introduced only into the Church declined in Purity, and ſerving meerly to maintain an extravagant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in every Father Confeſſor (that is, generally in every Prieſt) our Church has moſt deſervedly abrogated; and though there be <hi>ſome particular Caſes,</hi> in which, with the Holy Scriptures, and Ancient Church, we teach the <hi>confeſſing our Sins to Man,</hi> to be expedient, if not neceſſary alſo to our Peace with God; yet out of theſe Caſes is not confeſſing to man either requir'd, or even always fit.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40522:58"/> The <hi>Caſes</hi> wherein it is neceſſary, are but <hi>Three,</hi> as far as I am able to comprehend.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> That of <hi>Publick Scandal</hi> given to the Church by groſs and open ſin, whereby any perſon has forfeited his Chriſtianity, or his Right and Title as well to Heaven (or the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove) as to his Memberſhip of the Church on Earth. It is very neceſſary ſuch perſon take publick ſhame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and openly declare his Sin, to the end he may as openly declare, and give proof of his Repentance; and Chriſtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ſatisfied in communicating with him again. And <hi>this,</hi> if ſome will call a kind of <hi>ſatisfaction for</hi> ſin, they may have their pleaſure; provided they neither imagine, nor bear the World in hand it avails to make atonement for the guilt of Sin before God, in which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half nothing was, or ever will be meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, but the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe of having <hi>wronged any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon</hi> by Word or Deed, it is requiſite the Perſon who has done wrong, go to, or ſend for, meet, or otherwiſe apply to the party wronged, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40522:58"/> the wrong he has done; if able, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alſo ſatisfaction; if not, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his fault, and deſiring pardon and reconciliation. This is expreſly our Lord's Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 23, 24. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.</hi> And as far as <hi>this</hi> is any part of the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> required in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, under the ſame Caution as before, we not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend not, but moſt readily admit it; yea, and require it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In caſe of the <hi>guilt of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sin preſſing the Conſcience,</hi> and any <hi>doubts, fears,</hi> or <hi>diſquiets of Mind,</hi> which private Chriſtians are not able them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſatisfie: Nay in caſe any ſuſpect the weakneſs of their own Judgments, or proneneſs to flatter, and deal too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably with themſelves, (which Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions there are often great Reaſons for) ſuch perſons may, and ought to have recourſe to their ſpiritual Guide, who may direct them in truer, fuller, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40522:59"/> more ſufficient Methods of Repentance, inſtruct them in the Promiſes of Pardon, and pray with them, and for them, that they may obtain it. But in this Caſe we are now ſpeaking to, <hi>Confeſſion to a Miniſter</hi> ſtands in the Church, as an <hi>Act of Chriſtian Diſcretion</hi> and free choice, not of abſolute and perpetual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, much leſs is it in all Caſes of mortal Sin, a Duty, as it is made by ſome.</p>
               <p>For even in this Caſe we are now treating of, one Chriſtian Friend may moſt charitably and profitably confeſs his Sin to another, (though as we ſpeak, a Lay-Perſon) and beg his Counſel, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and Prayers to God for Pardon; which is the true ſenſe of St. <hi>James, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Confeſs your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed; the effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> But all theſe are particular Caſes (the two firſt alſo primarily and ordinarily neceſſary for reconciling our ſelves to Men, rather than to God; though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, where by particular Reaſons requiſite, and in our own power' we
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40522:59"/> cannot look upon our ſelves reconciled to God;) and ſo none of theſe belong abſolutely to Repentance in general, whereby in all kinds of Sin we make our peace with God, and which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſent conſideration. And thus far of Confeſſion whether to God or Man, as a third Step to, or Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Repentance.</p>
               <p>§. 11. A <hi>Fourth,</hi> and the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary of all, and, which of all yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, neareſt approacheth to, or even enters the very nature of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is <hi>forſaking Sin,</hi> that is, <hi>breaking off the Practice</hi> of it, and endeavouring to <hi>root out the Habit,</hi> Curſtom, yea, and all <hi>Inclination</hi> thereto.</p>
               <p>Now, if we duly conſider the great variety, or ſad abundance of the Habits of Sins in us, we ſhall ſoon diſcern the breaking our ſelves off them to be a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Work, and of a far vaſter ſcope and compaſs than we were at firſt aware of. For we have all of us Sins of Omiſſion as well as of Commiſſion, and no doubt, ſome Habits of both: Habits, I ſay, (moſt of us) of doing nothing, of Lazineſs put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, and totally neglecting Duties,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40522:60"/> as well as Habits of doing Evil, Habits of common Sloth, and Habits of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sloth (or of being backward to, dull and ſlow in all holy Duties) as well as Habits of Exceſs in eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, apparel, ſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Habits too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of Covetouſneſs, of Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of Ambition, of Pride, with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral inordinacy of Paſſions. All theſe, and other like, true Repentance breaks a man of; ſo that this our fourth Step will contain in it two Particulars, or a Negative and Poſitive Part, according to the Prophet; <hi>a ceaſing to do evil,</hi> and <hi>learning to do well;</hi> or the abandoning the old converſation (all ſinful Life and Practice,) and the Endeavour and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſuch Vertues and Duties which we before neglected, or which are moſt contrary to our former Evils; in the Language of the Apoſtle <hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 4. 22, 23.) <hi>Putting off concerning the former Converſation, the Old Man, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt according to the deceitful Luſts: And being renewed in the Spirit of our Mind.</hi> And indeed the Neceſſity and Method of Practiſing of both theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, is one and the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:40522:60"/>
               <p>§. 12. Firſt, As to the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of them both: Without both theſe all Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all the Contrition imaginable, all Confeſſions find not Mercy with God, nor avail to make our Peace. For the Promiſe of Mercy or Peace runs thus; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Sins ſhall find Mercy.</hi> And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking is clearly the more momentous Act, of much more weight and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than confeſſion. For in caſe of wickedneſs perſiſted in, God has prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not to hearken to our Confeſſions, Cries, or Prayers. <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will hide mine eyes from you; when ye make many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I will not hear,</hi> Iſa. 1. 15. <hi>But waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doing from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow: Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow; though they be red as Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Holy Ghoſt by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40522:61"/> 18. 21, 22. Obſerve here alſo as before thoſe two branches ſet diſtinctly, <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from all Sins, and keeping all God's Statutes, or doing that which is lawful and right.</hi> The ſame have we over again as diſtinctly, chap. 33. 19. of the ſame Prophet: Nor is the Doctrine of the New Teſtament different. This is the genuine and true meaning of <hi>putting off the Old Man with his deeds, and putting on the New Man,</hi> (Coloſſ. 3. 9, 10.) as it is by command made a duty, or can poſſibly be an act of ours: Nothing elſe but <hi>Eſchewing of evil, and doing good. (Habitually</hi> by conſtant endeavours and impartially) which St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo tells us is the Courſe, <hi>all they who love life,</hi> muſt ſtill take, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 10, 11. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that when many of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and People were Baptized of</hi> John, <hi>confeſſing their Sins,</hi> (thinking haply that Confeſſion with the Baptiſm of ſo holy a perſon (greater than whom had not been born of Woman) might ſtand them in much ſtead God-wards) the Holy Baptiſt entertains this confeſſing multitude with no better a welcome, than, <hi>O Generation of Vipers, Think</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40522:61"/> 
                  <hi>not to ſay with your ſelves we have Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But bring forth fruits meet for Repentance.</hi> As if he had ſaid, content not your ſelves with theſe Confeſſions, nor this Baptiſm, act and live as becomes true Penitents: <hi>For the Axe is</hi> (now under the Goſpel) <hi>laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the root of the Tree: Therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down, and caſt into the Fire.</hi> And to wave other no leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſayings both of our Lord and of his Apoſtles, St. <hi>Paul</hi> who at other times argues ſo earneſtly for <hi>Justification by Faith</hi> (as to ſome ſeems <hi>alone,</hi> though that phraſe or way of ſpeaking be no where found in Scripture, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſay) as if cautioning us againſt any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious inferences from that Doctrine expreſly tells us, <hi>In Christ Jeſus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing avails but a new Creature.</hi> Gal. 6. 15. which he calls <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Faith working by Love,</hi> and explains his ſence of both, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19.) <hi>to be keeping the Commandments of God.</hi> In ſhort no other is the ſcope of the whole Goſpel, and to this effect run all the promiſes or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances God any where gives us of peace
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40522:62"/> with him. For <hi>there is no peace, ſaith my God to the wicked:</hi> Iſai. 57. <hi>ult.</hi> Thus as to Promiſes and Commands to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And as to matter of Fact, that is perfectly agreeable hereto. It is very obſervable to this purpoſe, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of the body of the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of old, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 10. the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> having again and again done evil in the ſight of the Lord, he <hi>ſold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the Children of Ammon, and they vexed and oppreſſed them eighteen Years.</hi> In this time <hi>the Children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord ſaying, we have ſinned againſt thee, both becauſe we have forſaken our God and alſo ſerved Baalim.</hi> They cryed, that is prayed earneſtly, and as follows confeſt particularly, (1) Their Neglects and Omiſſions: We have forſaken our God: (2) Their Commiſſions: We have ſerved <hi>Baalim.</hi> To this their Confeſſion and Humiliation, what anſwer does God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? <hi>ver.</hi> 11. &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto the Children of Iſrael, did not I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you from the Egyptians, and from</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:40522:62"/> 
                  <hi>the Amorites, from the Children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and from the Philiſtines. The Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians alſo, and the Amalekites, and the Moabites did oppreſs you, and ye cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, and I delivered you out of their hand: Yet ye have forſaken me, and ſerved other Gods: Wherefore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you no more: Go and cry unto the Gods which ye have choſen, let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you in the time of your Tribulation.</hi> A ſad anſwer to the prayer, as would ſeem, of a Penitent as well as diſtreſſed Nation. But alas! they were not yet penitent. Well, they begin again to better effect, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>And the Children of Iſrael ſaid unto the Lord, we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do thou unto us whatſoever ſeemeth good unto thee, deliver us only we pray thee this day. And they put away their ſtrange Gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord?</hi> Aye, now they repent in good earneſt; for their Reformation is proportionable to their back ſliding. They <hi>had ſerved Baalim,</hi> that is, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heathen Gods or Idols as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Now therefore <hi>they put away their ſtrange Gods;</hi> plurally, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they had ſerved: They had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40522:63"/> their God,</hi> now therefore they <hi>ſerve the Lord;</hi> in the Original <hi>Jehovah,</hi> their and the only true God. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice God immediately adjudges real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and accordingly deals with them, <hi>And his Soul was grieved for the miſery of</hi> Iſrael, and accordingly he forthwith ſends them a deliverer. Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to this pattern muſt we model our Repentance, reforming actually accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all the inſtances wherein we have ſinned, if we deſire our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as theirs did, ſhould make our peace with God. Like Repentance will have like ſucceſs; that is, will reconcile God to us; but if we ſtop, as at firſt they did, at leſs than half way, we ſhall be ſent away, as they were, and left, till we make through work, under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpeaſure.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the neceſſity of both theſe Branches of forſaking Sin.</p>
               <p>§. 13. Now as to the <hi>Method of doing it,</hi> or the way of proceeding, and the ſeveral acts, by which we may break off our ſinful courſe; (for God knows this Change is a longer work than to be done ordinarily at one act or in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40522:63"/> this hath two parts. The firſt conſiſting of ſuch Gradual Acts as may be done for the preſent, and in one or ſome few Days. The ſecond of ſuch as require longer time and muſt be of great continuance.</p>
               <p>The former ſort I conceive it beſt ſo to divide, or branch forth, as to make thereof three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A general Reſolution</hi> (from the bottom of our hearts) <hi>touching intire amendment,</hi> or reforming our ſelves in all we now ſee, or ſhall at any time hereafter diſcover ſinful in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A Conſultation</hi> or due conſidering with our ſelves <hi>how we may effect ſuch amendment and Reformation;</hi> and that eſpecially as to ſuch particular caſes, wherein we find our ſelves to have been moſt faulty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A particular Reſolution,</hi> or (as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerves) <hi>Vow, touching the uſe of thoſe means,</hi> which we have found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt to amend us; and touching ſuch inſtances of our manners, which upon inquiry we have found to have moſt need of Reformation. And all theſe three muſt particularly go through both the former Branches.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:40522:64"/>
               <p>As to the Firſt, namely, a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of amendment and reformation, and that extending to all Acts and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, whether of Omiſſion or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which upon examination we find our ſelves to have been faulty. This was the ſubject and true import or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holy <hi>Barnabas</hi>'s exhortation to the People of <hi>Antioch</hi> in his Viſit of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. <hi>He exhorted them all, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</hi> Now by this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſolution, I mean, a conſiderate choice of, a ſteddy, mature determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or fixing the Will on impartial Holineſs. The truth of the Matter is, if Men were duly ſenſible of the ſtate of things, and convinced of thoſe unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Laws, by which God has reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to govern and judge the World, there needed no long conſideration in this Caſe. We have but a ſhort ſcope for Choice; either amendment or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torment; Holineſs, or never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee the face of God, but as he will be a dreadful Judge to condemn impenitent Sinners to everlaſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lames, and therein to the ſociety of Devils. This
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40522:64"/> very thought, one would think, ſhould quickly awaken people to the choice and purpoſe we preſs. However, that this is a proper Method appears, for that ſuch choice and purpoſe we find expreſly avowed by Holy Men, that is, by true Penitents in their practice, in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30. <hi>I have choſen the way of Truth: Thy Judgments have I laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> And, <hi>ver.</hi> 57. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>I have ſaid to keep,</hi> that is, I have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and reſolved with my ſelf to keep <hi>thy words.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 112. <hi>I have inclined</hi> (or bowed down) <hi>my heart</hi> [in the old Tranſlation well, I have applied my heart] <hi>to perform thy Statutes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the end.</hi> And in <hi>Joſhua,</hi> chap. 24. 15. <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Theſe Precedents abundantly ſhew how proper a ſtep <hi>this Particular,</hi> which I called a <hi>general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of entire amendment,</hi> is toward actual breaking off the courſe of ſinful Life.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, namely, <hi>due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi> or entring, as it were, into a conſultation with our ſelves how we may effect the Reformation we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40522:65"/> on: Herein we muſt exerciſe real Care, Thought, and Study; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps more care and thought than meerly our own: For it is much eaſier generally to purpoſe, than in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to perform amendment; much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier indeed to reſolve, as we think, upon a total reformation in all, than to bring our idle and deceitful hearts to it in any one particular Caſe: Here, therefore, I ſay, more and longer conſideration muſt be employed, and many a Petition (mean while) put up to God for guidance.</p>
               <p>Particularly, the Soul entring deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within its ſelf, by ſerious reflections, muſt put ſuch Queſtions as theſe to it ſelf. Firſt, What are the Sins which I have moſt lived in? <hi>What is mine Iniquity?</hi> Or the particular Sin or Sins that eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet me? Then, what Remedies can I find againſt them? For inſtance, Suppoſe idle ſpending my time, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance be a Sin of mine; it ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evil Company is a common ſnare thereto. A Remedy therefore of it is, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ill company; to harden my face, and my heart againſt many a gang of men that will thruſt themſelves upon me. For
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40522:65"/> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4.) <hi>They will think it ſtrange that I run not with them to the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of riot</hi> as formerly, <hi>ſpeaking evil of me.</hi> And by the way, this is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in general, that <hi>a conſtant and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal remedy against all or any Sin, is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the Temptations to them reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</hi> Conſider therefore, what draws or betrays thee into ſuch and ſuch Sins, and avoid that. This in all Caſes of Sin, or more than this, is moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Duty. For we are commanded, (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22.) <hi>to abſtain from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil.</hi> Now if Sin has any appearance, beſides that of its actual being, it certainly appears in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to it.</p>
               <p>Again, Suppoſe unjuſt dealing be my Sin, what leads me to it? Probably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Love of this World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>They that will be rich fall into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and perdition.</hi> No obſtacle, difficulty or hardſhip, no danger, ſhame, labour or pains will ſtand before that man in his way to ſin, who has ſet his heart on this World. Here therefore I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40522:66"/> muſt ſtrike at the Root, and mortifie this inordinate love of <hi>Mammon;</hi> I muſt conſider, <hi>Man's Life conſisteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi> Luke 12. 15. And have I not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry me tolerably through this World, and to leave ſufficiently alſo to my Family for their ſupport, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they will be vertuous and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? If I have ſo, 'tis a great queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without ſin I can ſeek after a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Eſtate: More would be only a load to me, and in all probability a ſnare too, both to <hi>Me and Mine.</hi> A Load, I ſay, by new and unneceſſary Cares, which that <hi>More</hi> would bring. And is it not a wrong to my ſelf to draw more Cares on my ſelf than are conſiſtent with my own Happineſs and God's Glory? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, more than enough would be a ſnare to me; for I ſhould ſtill thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more: For in all Caſes we ſee where men's thirſt or deſire is not ſatisfied with that which is enough, that is, which is convenient, there it never will be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And it will be a ſnare alſo to thoſe of mine to whom I leave it. For more than what will ſuffice them in a vertuous
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40522:66"/> induſtrious Life, does but tempt them to caſt aſide Vertue and Induſtry. And to leave them wherewithal to ſupport them in Vice and Idleneſs, I never ſhall be able, nor is it poſſible, if I ſhould leave them a Kingdom. But yet if I could leave wherewith to ſupport them in Vice or Idleneſs, yet I ought not. So that I ſay, it is moſt probable, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not propoſe to themſelves vaſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Eſtates (Eſtates beyond their degree) without Sin. Wherefore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough, as before ſaid, I ought therein to acquieſce, and ſatisfie my ſelf to enjoy it, and uſe it well, and lay aſide ſo much dealing in the World as perhaps I graſp at; which if I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon, I ſhall ſoon break my ſelf of unjuſt dealing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Soul, which would break it ſelf particularly of its peculiar courſe of ſinful Life, ſhould in ſecret ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs put alſo this Set of Queſtions to it ſelf.</p>
               <p>What are the Duties I have moſt groſly neglected? And what has drawn me to ſuch Neglect? And what Mean or Means will ſecure me againſt it, or
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40522:67"/> quicken me to the performance of my Duty? Now whatſoever I find that or thoſe Means to be, I muſt reſolve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>As ſuppoſe Prayer by my ſelf, or Prayer in my Family, is one Duty I have groſly neglected; and ſhamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fear of being laughed at, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Preciſian, or Fanatick, has betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to this neglect; let me conſider, Who are they I am aſhamed of it to? Or whoſe Laughter is it I fear? My Friend's? My Family's? Theſe I can admoniſh, check, and turn ſhame juſtly on them. Beſides, it is but ſpeaking of it to them beforehand, and this cures them of the Evil before it break out. Is it my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours reproach I fear? As to them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 24. 14. <hi>This I confeſs unto thee, that after the way which they call Hereſie, worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Did ſhame either hinder or drive theſe ancient Servants of God, in any point, from the due practice, and open profeſſion of their Chriſtianity? And may I then ſuffer my ſelf to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40522:67"/> thereby either hindred or driven from the ſame? At the Reſurrection of the Dead, and the Day of Judgment ſhall I be aſhamed either of having prayed in ſecret, or of having prayed in publick? Will then either the memory of the Act, or the reward of it put me to the Bluſh? And why ſhould it here? My Saviour was laugh'd at, publickly ſcoffed and ſcorned for my ſake; reproached with the imputation of Falſeneſs and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, as if he had only counterfeited himſelf to be the Son of God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World: And all this while he was actually employed in the ſevereſt part of the Work of my Salvation. <hi>He was reproached of men and deſpiſed of the people. All that ſaw him laughed him to ſcorn; they ſhot out the lip, they ſhook the head, ſaying, He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him; let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him, ſeeing he delighted in him, Pſal.</hi> 22. 6, 7, 8. And, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 39, 40, 41. <hi>They that paſſed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, Thou that deſtroyedst the Temple and buildedſt it in three days, ſave thy ſelf; if thou be the Son of God, come down from the</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:40522:68"/> 
                  <hi>Croſs. Likewiſe alſo the Chief Prieſts mocking him, with the Scribes and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. He was then too hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to hang upon the Croſs for me, <hi>making his Soul an Offering for my Sin.</hi> After this, how can I think of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him through any tenderneſs of face? Eſpecially, when I am at preſent in ſo far better (that is, eaſier and more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) Circumſtances than he was; I perhaps am laugh'd at by ſome Fools, or Mad-men, for obeying him; but I am otherwiſe at eaſe, and to have Heaven for the reward of overcoming this petty private affront. Shall then ſuch inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Trifles make me wave or forgo my Duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Far be it from me.</p>
               <p>In any other Caſe whatſoever, by like Conſultations or Conſiderations, as in theſe Caſes now ſet down, ſhall we, through God's Grace and Bleſſing upon our honeſt endeavour, find out particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar means, and by ſuch thought work our hearts to particular reſolution for breaking our ſelves of any other (or whatſoever) Sins we have found more peculiarly prevalent in us. And thus as to the ſecond Step of this Head of Practice.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:40522:68"/>
               <p>The Third will be, <hi>A particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, or</hi> (as occaſion ſerves) <hi>Vow, touching the uſe of thoſe Means,</hi> which we have found moſt proper to amend us, and touching ſuch inſtances of our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which upon enquiry we have found moſt to need Reformation. All general Reſolutions, we know, muſt be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in particular inſtances of Life and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore a particular Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching thoſe Means, which by conſideration we have found proper to each Caſe, will be no leſs neceſſary than the general Reſolution firſt propoſed as to the main Body of the Work.</p>
               <p>As for example; Suppoſe avoiding ill Company be one Means I have found out, to keep me from Intemperance and Exceſs, or from loſs of Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I'll immediately reſolve not only againſt looſe, but againſt vain Companions; I'll keep home more, abandon certain Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars, eſtrange my ſelf from ſuch and ſuch; I'll ſet my ſelf certain employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo much for ſuch a time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe again, contenting my ſelf with ſufficient Proviſions, (and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a too peremptory Reſolution I had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40522:69"/> taken up to be rich to ſuch a degree) be the Means I have diſcovered proper for the remedying my unjuſt oppreſſive dealing, I'll reſolve on that, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately order my Affairs according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>But in ſuch Caſes as theſe, perhaps ſingle reſolution will not ſuffice to hold our unſtable Souls; ſometimes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but with much caution and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, we may do well to add Vow. <hi>David,</hi> or whatever holy Man was the Author of that Pſalm, did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 51. <hi>I have ſaid,</hi> (that is, reſolved with my ſelf) <hi>to keep thy Words,</hi> and leſt that ſhould not do, <hi>ver.</hi> 106. <hi>I have ſworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus as to the firſt Part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for breaking our ſelves of Sin, by ſuch Acts as are to be done for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which are to be continued are, the proſecution of theſe Reſolutions or Vows by a conſtant ſtudy of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by daily endeavours of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Holyneſs, through the whole following part of our Life. Now the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40522:69"/> treating hereof belongs not to this firſt Claſs of Advices, but is to be ſet down in the ſecond Part.</p>
               <p>In the mean while we are to proceed with what yet remains for our preſent making our peace with God.</p>
               <p>§. 14. And now after this Practice of Repentance; <hi>Faith interpoſes again,</hi> and that not meerly Faith towards God, or a belief of the Being, Nature, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, as hitherto moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, but <hi>Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or Faith as called by the Apoſtle. Rom. 3. 25. <hi>Faith in his Blood.</hi> For <hi>him</hi> (as bleeding for us upon the Croſs, as ſacrificed upon that Altar) <hi>hath God ſet forth to be a propitiation,</hi> and it is <hi>by the Blood of his Croſs</hi> that <hi>he made peace, Col.</hi> 1. 20. 'Tis the <hi>Blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit, offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot to God, that purges our Conſciences from dead Works, to ſerve the living God, Heb.</hi> 9. 14. 'Tis <hi>by that one offering he hath perfected forever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. <hi>This is that Fountain ſet open to the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for Sin and for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> Zechar. 13. 1.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:40522:70"/>
               <p>Hither therefore after all Confeſſions, Contrition, Tears, Reſolutions, Vows and endeavours of Reformation the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul comes; Here it exerts new Acts of Faith, that is <hi>Truſt, Affiance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</hi> And as the Holy perſons <hi>(Matth.</hi> 28. 9.) did corporally to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour after his Reſurection, ſo muſt true Penitents, as it were catching the Crucified Jeſus by the Feet, hold him faſt after a ſpiritual ſort, as their only hope and refuge, that only name given under Heaven, that Dear Jeſus <hi>which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the Wrath to come;</hi> and with Chriſt thus, not in their Arms but Heart, look up to the Eternal Father for pardon and peace, through the Son of his Loves. This diſtinct truſt in Chriſt, as ſacrificed for our Sins, in this Order (or thus in conjunction with ſuch practice of Repentance as ſet down) exerted or exerciſed, I conceive of moſt eſſential and ſingular Force to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting our Peace both with God, and in our own Conſciences.</p>
               <p>§. 15. And now I ſee not any thing which remains (ſpeaking as to a certain
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40522:70"/> courſe of tranſient Acts) ordinarily to compleat a Man's Reconciliation with God, except we ſhould ſay, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Cloath all theſe Acts with <hi>ſerious and ſuitable Prayer.</hi> Prayer is that Chriſtian Duty, which as I may ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as it were, gives a body to all the Acts of Grace in the Soul; or (as one well obſerves) <q>It is indeed that ſingle Duty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen, <hi>of the Spirit of Prayer.</hi>
                     </note> every Geace is acted, every Sin oppoſed, every good thing obtained or impetrated of God.</q> Without it Contrition, and Faith, and Reſolution, are after a ſort airy and volatil. This fixes them, and makes them ſubſtantial, mature and permanent; Nay, it raiſes and ſtrengthens, or heightens them. Prayer is ſuch an Office, as not only actuates, or draws out into Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe all Chriſtian Graces, but makes the Soul more earneſt and zealous in the Actings of them? Having therefore proceeded, as above directed, towards making thy Peace with God, caſt thy ſelf in ſecret at the Throne of Grace in earneſt and humble ſupplication, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and bewailing thy Sin, with the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40522:71"/> Exerciſe of all the Contrition thou canſt excite; paſſing Sentence on thy ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging what thou haſt deſerved, but withall pleading the Sacrifice of the Death of Chriſt, the atonement made by the Blood of his Croſs, and caſting thy ſelf upon God's mercy, through that great and alone true Propitiation; bringing indeed the heartieſt Purpoſes, and making the firmeſt Reſolutions thou can'ſt, endeavouring to the utmoſt of thy Power to perform all that concerns thee on thy part by the Covenant of Grace; but after all acknowledging thy ſelf an unprofitable ſervant, <hi>(Luke</hi> 17. 10.) diſclaiming therefore any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thine own, and beſeeching Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for thy very Repentance; begging to be ſprinkled with the Blood of Jeſus, and to be found in him. For he is <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs:</hi> And thus in him, and through him, thou ſhalt find Peace.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Whoſo has thus proceeded, may be preſumed for the preſent (as to what can be effected by private Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations) to have made their Peace with God. Only they muſt be careful <hi>in the</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:40522:71"/> 
                  <hi>ſequel</hi> or following part of their Life <hi>to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> and (as both has been ſuggeſted, and will be further given in directions) to purſue, or go on in Holineſs, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this temper and ſtate by all ſuitable Endeavours to their lives end.</p>
               <p>And it will be highly convenient, if any poſſible opportunity offer, to come ſolemnly to the Great Sacrament of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, the Lord's Supper, the beſt Seal in this kind; and thither to bring our Reſolutions and Vows, there to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them to God, and form them into a Covenant with him; publickly, before Men and Angels, devoting and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating our ſelves to him, in the Union of his Church, through our Crucified Lord. And thus upon the whole, of a Man's preſent making his Peace with God: Which is a Second ſtep in our Firſt Stage of Preparation towards a happy Death.</p>

HE who has been careful and conſcientious in his endeavors to reconcile himſelf to God, as before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, may through our <hi>Lord Chriſt, who is our Peace,</hi> come with an humble bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Father: He may <hi>in his name ask</hi> of the Father whatſoever he can need, or finds himſelf at a loſs for, and he ſhall receive it: He may in ſpecial ask of him <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> and <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Heaven;</hi> Nay, he ought now to think of no happineſs below Heaven; but there to place his heart, there to ſettle his affections, and in a word, as our Lord enjoyns, <hi>to lay up his Treaſure in Heaven,</hi> the doing which is the next advice or third ſtep in this our firſt Stage.</p>
               <p>But for ſinful Duſt and Aſhes to aim ſo high, may perhaps, at firſt ſeem to many poor dejected Souls as much a preſumption, as to ſecure a happineſs in Heaven ſeems to carnal Men impoſſible. Nay 'tis not improbable, many may be much at a loſs, what conceptions to frame of any happineſs there at all. We have been here ſo accuſtomed to live
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40522:78"/> meerly by ſenſe, that we can conceive of little or nothing, which falls not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſenſes. What the pleaſures of Eating and Drinking are, what ſleep and carnal joys, we know too well. But what happineſs there can be in a World, where 'tis ſaid there's none of theſe, we cannot eaſily apprehend. It will therefore be neceſſary here, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to ſhew what that Happineſs is, which we are to propoſe to our ſelves in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to prove, in a few words, that for perſons, who have made their peace with God, 'tis not preſumption, but their Duty as well as Intereſt, to lay up their Treaſure, or place their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Heaven, and indeed in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> to aſſign ſuch means whereby we may ſecure to our ſelves the heavenly Happineſs or Treaſure.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And Firſt, to give ſome account, <hi>what that happineſs in Heaven is,</hi> which we are to propoſe to our ſelves: Not at preſent ſo largely and diſtinctly, as in a fitter place will be expedient to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but at leaſt generally, and in the groſs, ſo as may inflame our deſires after it, and excite our diligence to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:40522:79"/>
               <p>The happineſs above then, is a <hi>State of fuller and more abſolute bleſſedneſs and joy than here we are able to conceive of:</hi> A State wherein all our <hi>reaſonable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> ſhall be <hi>made perfect,</hi> and <hi>perfectly imployed</hi> on ſuch things which will be moſt intirely ſuitable and ſatisfactory to them. And not only the Soul thus rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but even the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf ſhall be <hi>exalted to ſuch a degree of Purity,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Eaſe,</hi> as to have nothing in it or about it, which argues any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in its kind; nothing which can hinder the mind in its nobleſt Actions, nothing which can affect the Man with any inconvenience. We ſhall <hi>ſee God as he is, face to face:</hi> See him I ſay, with the eyes of our mind, not theſe poor weak bodily ones. That is, <hi>we ſhall know him, even as we our ſelves are known,</hi> (1 Cor. 13. 12.) not indirectly, or by a long compaſs about, as we now do, but intuitively by immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as it were looking ſtraight upon him. The mind ſhall be ſo raiſed, as to be able to conceive truly and properly of the Being, Nature and Perfections of God. <hi>Our bodily Eyes</hi> indeed ſhall <hi>behold</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:40522:79"/> 
                  <hi>the Lord Jeſus,</hi> for he has a body viſibly to be beheld, and even this certainly will be a glorious and moſt raviſhing ſight.</p>
               <p>Beſides we ſhall be <hi>fitted for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> of pure Intelligences, that is of <hi>Holy Angels;</hi> and for enjoying the familiarity of all the <hi>Bleſſed Saints:</hi> We ſhall be with Saints and Angels, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the <hi>admiration, love</hi> and <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God and Chriſt.</hi> We ſhall then know too, what the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is,</hi> and be full thereof. We ſhall underſtand plainly what we at preſent ſee only (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) through <hi>a perſpective Glaſs and in a Riddle,</hi> how <hi>thoſe three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt are one.</hi> All the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires both of the Mind and of the Will,</hi> that is, all our deſires after <hi>truth, good,</hi> and any agreeables, ſhall be at once <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſatisfied,</hi> and yet, with ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Eternally flowing forth</hi> to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Fountain of all Truth and Good, the <hi>Eternal Infinite God:</hi> No <hi>Memory</hi> or <hi>Senſe</hi> of any thing <hi>paſt,</hi> or of any thing <hi>here below</hi> remaining with us, any otherwiſe, than as ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40522:80"/> may <hi>heighten our preſent tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport</hi> or raviſhment. And <hi>all this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> is to be <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> without <hi>End,</hi> without <hi>Intermiſſion,</hi> without <hi>Allay.</hi> This is for the main, ſuch an account as here may ſuffice to be given of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Happineſs. But we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is infinitely ſhort of the full real Truth. For 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>3. Now, Secondly; as vaſt and infinite as this Happineſs is, that it is <hi>no preſumption in a faithful Soul</hi> (and ſuch certainly are all who have ſo, as directed, made their peace with God) I ſay that it is no preſumption in ſuch a Soul to deſire, pray for, aim at and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, this Happineſs is evident, becauſe God has offered it in the Goſpel. The propoſal of this, and of its means, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the opening our way to it, was the Great Errand and buſineſs, on which Chriſt Jeſus came into the World: <hi>God ſent his Son into the World,</hi> not to condemn the World (to keep them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40522:80"/> that Sentence of Condemnation and Death, which by Sin had taken place upon them) <hi>but that the World through him might be ſaved. For God,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>ſo loved the World, that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> And accordingly our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>aboliſhed Death,</hi> (2 Tim. 1. 10.) <hi>and brought Life and Immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> The Goſpel publiſhes the conditions, ways, or means, by which it is to be had (which we have ſeen in part and ſhall further ſee as we proceed) and requires us, thus to ſeek it, under pain of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery, if we do not. And that Men of all ſorts and tempers might be invited thereunto, and prevailed with, our Lord Jeſus has taken care it ſhould be propoſed under ſuch various Notions and Characters as may comply with all Mens tempers. To draw in <hi>Ambitious Men</hi> it is propoſed as <hi>Honour and Glory,</hi> as a <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>Throne,</hi> a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c. To gain <hi>Men of pleaſure,</hi> it is repreſented as a <hi>Banquet,</hi> a <hi>Supper,</hi> a <hi>Marriage Feaſt, fullneſs of Joy</hi> and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40522:81"/> 
                  <hi>Pleaſures for evermore,</hi> &amp;c. To allure <hi>Men that love Wealth,</hi> it is called a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> a <hi>Treaſure which neither Moth nor Ruſt can corrupt, nor Thieves break through and ſteal,</hi> the <hi>true Riches,</hi> an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible,</hi> &amp;c. And to be brief, to take with ſome others, it is perhaps called by other names: But in a word to take with all, foraſmuch as <hi>all Men love Life,</hi> and moſt people <hi>Long Life,</hi> it is called, what it is moſt truly, <hi>Everlaſting Life.</hi> Upon the whole, God is ſo deſirous, that none ſhould neglect it, that it is propounded to all I ſay in a way to ſuit each Mans Temper, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Inclination. The commands to purſue it are ſo many, that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needful, nor indeed eaſie, to reckon them all up: The Encouragements ſo great, that it is not poſſible to add to them; witneſs that one Command, and Superlative Encouragement: <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you,</hi> Matth. 6. 33. What can be added to all things? Yet the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> (that is all things good for them) ſhall they receive, who
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40522:81"/> ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee in ſome meaſure both what this Happineſs is, and that it is in Strictneſs our Duty to ſeek after it, or endeavour to ſecure it.</p>
               <p>§ 4. It is now high time to enquire, thirdly, how or by what means we may ſecure it. How ſhall we convey Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thither? Or how is it poſſible, there to <hi>lay up our Treaſure?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer hereto, the Directions ſhall be few and eaſy; of which the firſt is,</p>
               <p>Whoever would have a Happineſs in Heaven, muſt <hi>By Reſolution and Prayer chuſe God for his Happineſs;</hi> for it is the Enjoyment of him that makes both Heaven and Happineſs, without Him is neither poſſible. And the <hi>Almighty God,</hi> all that he is, Infinite as he is, is content to be the Happineſs of ſuch poor Worms as are we mortal Men. He of old ſaid unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him the Father of the Faithful, to every (even the meaneſt) faithful Soul, <hi>Fear not, I am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward,</hi> Gen. 15. 1. And he ſays the ſame at preſent to every diſpoſed perſon, who
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40522:82"/> reads or hears this. Take God then at his Word: And firſt reſolve with thy ſelf, and ſay inwardly in Spirit, <hi>God ſhall be the portion of my Soul.</hi> Let others pleaſe themſelves in other Goods, in <hi>the Encreaſe of Corn, and Wine, and Oyl,</hi> in <hi>joyning Houſe to Houſe, and Field to Field,</hi> in <hi>loading themſelves with thick Clay,</hi> or <hi>laying up Treaſure upon Earth for many years;</hi> for my part I will take up with none of theſe; <hi>the Almighty God ſhall be my portion.</hi> Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf (for of him prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically is that Pſalm to be interpreted) did, while in the Fleſh, ſo reſolve, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my Cup, thou main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest my lot.</hi> Fear not then thou for whom Chriſt died, to the end thou mighteſt come to the Father by a new and living Way, through his bloud: Fear not I ſay, neither forbear, thus to come, thus to reſolve.</p>
               <p>And having thus inwardly reſolved with thy ſelf, <hi>Take with thee words,</hi> and apply thy ſelf faithfully and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by Prayer to God; telling him, that thou art reſolved to make the ſame
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40522:82"/> Choice as thy Saviour, not only by his Doctrine, but by his Practice and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample taught thee. Tell him whatever Portion of things below he has given thee, or ſhall give thee, thou art reſolv'd not to be put off with any, with all theſe; nothing below himſelf ſhall ſatisfy thee, for indeed nothing below him can. And to inſure the Choice, that he may give himſelf to thee, tell him thou giveſt thy ſelf to him (but be ſure thou doſt ſo.) Tell him thou wilt leave thy Heart, thy Soul and Affections with him at preſent, never again to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn; at leaſt, thou deſireſt with all thy heart they never may be withdrawn: Beſeech him that he will keep them to himſelf, and accept of thee; that he will vouchſafe to become thy Happineſs, and make thee know he is ſo. Try him thus, and ſee if he will refuſe thee. If he ſhould, he muſt do that he never did yet; nay, he muſt do what he has ſaid he never will do. <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Chriſt at leaſt has ſaid it; and Chriſt and his Father are one.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:40522:83"/>
               <p>Secondly, having once ſolemnly made this Choice, accuſtom thy ſelf <hi>in thy daily Devotions</hi> to go to God, to look on him, and <hi>claim him as thy Portion.</hi> The Saints in Scripture often did ſo. <hi>David,</hi> when in the Cave for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and ſeemingly caſt off, did ſo. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 5. <hi>I cried unto thee, O Lord; I ſaid thou art my refuge, and my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the land of the living. Aſaph</hi> did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth: but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> And whoſoever was the Author of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. at ver. 57. did ſo. <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord, I have ſaid, that I would keep thy words.</hi> And <hi>Jeremy</hi> did ſo, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my Soul, therefore will I hope in him.</hi> Nay, God himſelf ſeems to have delighted to be ſo called, <hi>Jer</hi> 10. 16. <hi>The portion of</hi> Jacob <hi>is not like them:</hi> that is, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> the alone true God is not like the gods of the Nations. And again chap. 50. 19. to the ſame Effect. In both places this ſeems to be put as a Name no leſs peculiar to God, than his <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable Name</hi> Jehovah. Nay, it is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40522:83"/> more than this, if more can be: <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 9. <hi>The Lord's portion is his people, Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</hi> O infinite Condeſcention! God is his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Portion, and they are his. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou canſt make it out to thy ſelf (that is, if thy Heart bear thee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) that thou haſt given thy ſelf up to God to be his, and haſt thus made Choice of God to be thy Happineſs, doubt not to call him thine, <hi>thy portion, thy exceeding great reward, thy God,</hi> and make thy humble and frequent Claim to him as ſuch. This will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ratify thy Choice, and as I may ſay, more endear thee to thy heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and him to thee. This will fill thee, by degrees, with Joy and Peace in believing. This will give thee ſome taſt of Heaven, and the Enjoyment of God before-hand.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Eſpecially, if thou be diligent in (what is the next Direction) an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be full of good Works;</hi> for by theſe we lay up Treaſure in Heaven: By theſe we not only ſecure our right to Glory, but through the infinite Grace of God, according to his Method
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40522:84"/> and Promiſe of rewarding, we add to that exceeding great and eternal weight of Glory reſerved in Heaven for us. In the Goſpel, <hi>the Servant,</hi> who <hi>by one pound</hi> committed to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 12. &amp;c.</note> his management, had <hi>gained five pounds,</hi> was <hi>made ruler over five Cities;</hi> and he who <hi>had gained ten pounds, over ten Cities.</hi> There will be a <hi>Proportion</hi> between every Man's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and his <hi>Work;</hi> not indeed of commutative Juſtice, as if our good Works could properly merit, or bring God in Debt to us, but of Grace and liberal diſtributive Juſtice; God of his abundant Goodneſs approportioning the Recompence of Reward to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Mens Labours, Pains and Coſt, whether <hi>in doing good,</hi> or <hi>ſuffering ill</hi> and hardſhip for his ſake; both which kinds of Acts may in ſome Sence be called good Works.</p>
               <p>But it will be here neceſſary, that we look a little more cloſely into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good Works</hi> then may be ſo called ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a <hi>general</hi> or <hi>ſpecial</hi> Sence.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:40522:84"/>1. In a general one: As every Act (eſpecially every outward Action) may be called a Work, ſo every good Action may be called a good Work. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4, 8. <hi>Every one who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin,</hi> that is, <hi>who tranſgreſſeth the Law, doth the works of the Devil.</hi> So he that Acts any thing in obedience to, and <hi>Congruity with the Law of God,</hi> does a <hi>good work,</hi> or <hi>the work of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 6. But Uſe has obtained, that we call thoſe <hi>chiefly,</hi> or <hi>eminently good works,</hi> which are <hi>good and profitable to Men,</hi> that is, to other Men, and the Publick. Of which Nature is <hi>giving of Alms,</hi> building and <hi>endowing Alms-Houſes,</hi> Hoſpitals, Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of theſe latter it is to be obſerved, that there is too great a Difference very often betwixt <hi>the Action</hi> and <note place="margin">Ames de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiâ Lib.</note> 
                  <hi>the Work:</hi> So that though the Work be good, the Action may be ſtark naught, or but very indifferent. As for Inſtance, the Phariſee gives Alms, but <hi>(Matth.</hi> 6.) he ſounds a Trumpet, in pretence perhaps, to call together the Poor, but in reality to proclaim his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40522:85"/> Liberality. The relieving the Poor with his Alms is a good Work, but thus giving Alms is vain Glory and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Pride.</p>
               <p>Again a man going out of the World leaves Money to build and endow an Alms-Houſe, or for ſome ſuch publick Good; but while he was alive, he ſat hatching over all he had, and would not part with a Penny to any good Uſe, nor would he now haply, if he could keep it any longer; no nor give it to this Uſe, if he had Children of his own, or any whom he loved well enough to leave it to. Now ſuppoſe ſuch Bequeſts or Foundations to be or to have been ſome other Mens Acts at preſent deceaſed, I would neither my ſelf cenſure, nor teach others to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſure any deceaſed Perſon's Charity or bounty in his Will. But ſuppoſing it likely to be the Caſe of my ſelf, or of any man living, I ſhould think ſuch Bequeſt ſcarce ſo much as indifferently or tolerably a good Work; for it would ſeem to me an <hi>Act of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> more than of <hi>Charity.</hi> But bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter late than never, as they ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let ſuch Actions paſs as they ſhall.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40522:85"/> Notwithſtanding it is to be ſaid, and muſt be acknowledged touching all good works of this latter kind, theſe are good works, which only rich men can do; and ſo this is a Method wherein only one, and that far the ſmalleſt part of Chriſtians, can lay up Treaſure in Heaven.</p>
               <p>§. 7. But in the former ſenſe, the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and meaneſt, as well as <hi>Richeſt</hi> ſort, even all Chriſtians of what degree ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, may be rich and ought to abound, in good works. And that we may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſee how, we will take one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in each kind of Duties. 1. In Duties towards God: <hi>Prayers</hi> and ſuch kind of <hi>Devotions,</hi> in <hi>time of Leiſure, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Vigor,</hi> ſent up to Heaven, againſt a time of need, and eſpecially againſt a dying hour, are <hi>Good Works:</hi> Even poor Widows, maintained by the Church, both may and (according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sentiments) if Religious will, I am ſure, ought to abound in theſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> V. 5. <hi>She that is a Widow indeed and deſolate, trusteth in God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in ſupplications and prayers night and day.</hi> And it is certain, Prayers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40522:86"/> ſent up to Heaven, though not ſpeedily anſwered, are not loſt, but are a Treaſure laid up there againſt a time of need; anſwered ſometimes even in this World, at a diſtance, but moſt certainly in another. In 1 <hi>King.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> on the place.</note> ix. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> has an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Prayer, made in the Temple thirteen years before. This indeed was only for Hallowing an Earthly Temple: But the inſtance, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 4. was of Prayers that ſped for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſpiritual one. <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as well as his <hi>Alms, were come up for a Memorial before God;</hi> and they are anſwered by no leſs a bleſſing than the gift of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>(v.</hi> 44.) that was, even by a Heaven upon Earth; for the Holy Ghoſt in a Man's heart will turn Earth, or any thing here to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

               <p n="2">2. In Duties to our ſelves: All acts of Sobriety, Purity, Self-denial and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification are good works; and in theſe or moſt of theſe, all ſorts of Chriſtians may abound. That they are good works, and even in the beſt Men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

               <p>Not one act then, wherein I have foregone my own will, appetite, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination, for God or my Duties ſake, but God obſerves it, and it ſtands as if recorded before him, againſt the day of Recompences. Every hour's ſleep which at any time in my life I broke, or ſhall break, to pray or meditate, or examine Conſcience, or for any other work of Devotion, or of Charity: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faſt I have kept or ſhall keep; every day's pleaſure or recreation, I have denied my ſelf; every penny and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I have forborn to lay out upon my ſelf or vanities, or ſhall ſpare from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying my humour, or tricking up my body (this pitiful houſe of clay, which I carry about) ſtealing it poſſibly into a poor Man's hands, or houſe, every of theſe acts, paſt or future, is and will be regarded by God, and ſo proves a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure laid up in Heaven.

               </p>
               <p>§. 8. But, as we have above obſerved, in common ſpeech (and indeed even in the uſual language of Scripture) the <hi>term good works</hi> more <hi>peculiarly ſignifies works of Charity</hi> and Liberality; and the doing ſuch is more eſpecially (and even <hi>literally)</hi> ſaid to be a <hi>laying up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heaven.</hi> Luk. 12. 33, 34. <hi>Sell that ye have, and give Alms, provide your ſelves bags, which wax not old, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth: For where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo.</hi> And in 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but in the living God, who giveth</hi>

                  <hi>us all things to enjoy. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> Now though it may ſeem, at firſt, that in this kind of good works, namely thoſe uſually called works of Charity, only rich people are capable of laying up Treaſure in Heaven, or providing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hereafter any meaſure of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet if we conſider, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Offices, or kind ſervices, that even the meaneſt ſort ſometimes may perform to their Superiors, and that ſuch ſervices are of real value, we may and muſt account, that poor people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to do all the good they can to the Bodies, Souls, Eſtates, or good names of others, are as really charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and (if diligent to do ſuch good) as abundant in the work of Charity, in their way, as the moſt magnificent publick Benefactors in theirs; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently will be as ſurely and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rewarded. <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet ſhall</hi>

                  <hi>receive a Prophets reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man's reward: And whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones, a cup of cold water only, in the name of a diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward,</hi> Mat. 10. 41, 42. In which ſurpriſing promiſe, and (as it were) exceſs of Divine grace and goodneſs, poor people ought, for their comfort, to take notice of three things, (1) How <hi>ſmall matters</hi> from them, to whom little is given, God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems as <hi>Alms:</hi> Even a <hi>Cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given to a fellow Chriſtian,</hi> as ſuch; or haply a <hi>little room or harbour,</hi> in a corner of the poor Cottage, to a weary or wet Paſſenger. (2) How largely God will reward it, with a righteous man's, or a Prophet's reward, according to the nature of the perſon we deſigned to do good to. (3) The ſureneſs of the reward. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward;</hi> that is, by an ordinary Figure, he ſhall moſt certainly receive it: Let no one then think, he cannot be Charitable or bountiful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40522:90"/> he is not rich; but let him not fail to do all the good <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 33.</note> to others that lies in his way: Hereby he provides himſelf <hi>Bags, which wax not old, a treaſure in heaven that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not:</hi> That is, he makes a happy preparation for another world.</p>
               <p>§. 9. But there is one ſort of good works, or of Charity to others, which tranſcends far all other Bounty; and that is <hi>Charity to the ſouls of Men,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in inſtructing thoſe, who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God and of their Duty, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving and delivering men from a leud courſe of life, to being ſerious and ſtrict in Religion; in bringing them home to Chriſt and his Church. This is a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as far ſurpaſſing that which is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended to Mens bodies, as the ſoul in excellence ſurpaſſeth the body. He that can help a ſoul to Heaven before him, hath certainly ſent an unvaluable treaſure thither. <hi>For if any man err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know that he which converteth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the error of his ways, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſins,</hi> James <hi>the last,</hi> 19, 20.

               </p>
               <p>§. 1 THoſe who have practiſed the former Advices or Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may be preſumed to have ſecured to themſelves a Happineſs in the other World; wherefore, being that it is moſt ſure they muſt ſhortly, and they know not how ſoon, depart hence, it now is both juſt and ſeaſonable to move them to <hi>Diſentangle themſelves from this World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the proving this to be all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Peoples both <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> let it but be granted (what is above ſet forth and has been proved) that it is our Duty and Intereſt to be <hi>always ready,</hi> and this inavoidably follows, that it is our Duty to be diſentangled. For is a Man ready for a Journey who has Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Bolts on, or who is loaden with Chains and Irons, which it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a ſhort time to knock off, or rid him from? No more is the Man who is involved in the cares and buſineſs, but eſpecially in the Love of this World,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40522:95"/> fit or ready for his paſſage into that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country; a Country or State wherein we are to live at another rate, than we do here; and for the Purity and Liberty whereof, we muſt be ſomewhat prepared by a holy and abſtract Life, before we can be capable of being bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therein.</p>
               <p>Nor does it ſeem needful to inlarge in ſhewing, how ſinful as well as how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable it is, for a Man to incumber himſelf or to remain incumbred, more than by his Duty neceſſitated, in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs. There is nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known than our Lord's repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or check to that buſy good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Luke 10. 41. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.</hi> The original terms <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> aptly expreſs the Courſe and Nature of many of our Lives. They are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>a State of diſtraction and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult;</hi> Nor can any thing be more plain than that the <hi>cares of this Life and love of this World,</hi> and buſy ploding about it do <hi>put the Mind and Affections at as great a distance from God</hi> as do moſt of thoſe <hi>Sins</hi> which are reputed the moſt

                  <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> affirms thus much; commanding (1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15.) that we <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World. If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And we have above had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to conſider the ſad truth of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s obſervation touching Men that are reſolved to be rich. 1 Tim. 6. 9, 10. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which drown Men in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Perdition. For the love of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is the Root of all Evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the Faith and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> In a word, <hi>no wiſe</hi> Man <hi>will, no Christian</hi> Man <hi>can, look</hi> upon the <hi>beſt Condition,</hi> or moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and firm ſettlement in this World, any otherwiſe than as a <hi>Good Inn to a Traveller.</hi> If we can get but conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Refreſhments and Neceſſaries to paſs on with comfort, it is as much as we ſhould look after. The <hi>way-faring Man, who turneth in to ſtay for a Night,</hi> would be eſteemed a Mad Man if he ſhould ſpend the time wherein he ſhould eat,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40522:96"/> reſt and ſleep, in furniſhing his Room, and laying in Stores of Proviſions and Superfluities, as if he were to abide there for term of Life. And juſt ſo wiſe a Courſe is it for us, who <hi>have here no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding place,</hi> but are only to paſs on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, to ſpend thoſe Days and Years, which God has allotted us for Life, and furniſhing our Souls with Knowledge, Grace and Vertue to qualify us for Heaven, meerly in Earthly Cares and Labours, and in endleſs Perplexities about compaſſing Wealth, which we muſt leave behind us (for ought we know before to morrow morning) to him that comes next; and which will be our loſs rather than advantage, when we come unto our true Home and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Good Works may follow us, but Money or Great Eſtates cannot, except it be to appear in Judgment againſt us; for coming unjuſtly by them, or ſetting our hearts too much upon them; and ſo, enſlaving our ſelves to them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king meer Earth-worms of our Souls.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But it is much more eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the ſinfulneſs, unreaſonable and miſchievous conſequents of worldly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40522:97"/> incumbrances, than to caſt them off, or find our a proper way to be rid of them. And the miſchief is, Men are uſually unwilling to be delivered of this Evil. They are golden Chains which this World caſts about us, and thoſe Men think too precious to fling away.</p>
               <p>However, let me conſider, have I a Treaſure in Heaven? Is God my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Does this World only put me at enmity with God, at leaſt keep me at a diſtance with him? Does it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe and enſlave my Soul, as I cannot but be ſenſible? Shall I not then be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be free from buſineſs and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? To be in perfection and poſſeſs'd of a bliſful State? To behold God face to face? To love admire and enjoy him, rejoycing before him, and in him, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally? Without Wearineſs, without Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety, nay even without Intermiſſion or Allay of the higheſt pleaſure my Nature is capable of? Can I refrain deſiring, at leaſt conſenting to be thus bleſſed? Can I chooſe but long for ſuch Change, and to that purpoſe ſhall I not ſit looſe to any thing that ſhall hinder it? Now if I du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend to my own daily Experience,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40522:97"/> my worldly Affairs, Cares, and Buſineſs, do much hinder any preſent Reliſh of, or Preparedneſs for theſe Joys; They take me off even from minding them, and if I ſuffer them ſtill to poſſeſs my Thoughts and Affections, they will hinder me in my very paſſage to them; nay poſſibly obſtruct it totally. Let me then reſolve to put both my Self and Affairs into ſuch Order, as that I may at any time be ready to quit them, whenſoever and howſoever my Lord ſhall Call. Let my <hi>mind be ſo compoſed,</hi> and my <hi>worldly Affairs ſo diſpoſed,</hi> as that if God pleaſe ſuddenly to Call me hence, there may be nothing in my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which may much require my lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger attendance on them, and I my ſelf may be as willing to leave them, as they are fit to be left; which is the <hi>Fourth Duty</hi> in Order to a Happy Death, and what we are at preſent to conſider more narrowly.</p>
               <p>Here indeed may ſeem to be <hi>Two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Duties</hi> put together under one Head. The <hi>Reducing our Worldly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> into ſuch Order, and <hi>our Minds</hi> to ſuch a frame, as that we may be
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40522:98"/> ready for a ſudden removal. But the <hi>main intention</hi> and effect aimed at <hi>being one and ſingle,</hi> namely the <hi>Soul's diſintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement</hi> or freedom for its flight, and that not being to be obtained, but by theſe two joynt means, and they too ſo interfering, as we ſhall ſee, there was reaſon thus to joyn or unite them. For ſuppoſing a Mans Worldly Affairs in confuſion and diſordered, it will be very hard for him, even upon the moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and unavoidable approach of death, ſo to quiet himſelf as to be willing to go inſtantly out of this World, and leave them ſo. Again, ſuppoſe a Mans Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs never ſo well modelled and ſettled, but yet his heart running out after the World, and fixing upon it, it will be impoſſible for him with eaſe to quit or bid adieu to what he deſires ſo much, and ſo paſſionately delights in, or dotes upon. Theſe two therefore in practice cannot and muſt not be ſeparated, nor is there any diſentanglement except both be effected. But ſuppoſe ſuch care and practice as to both, as here dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, there will enſue a certain diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40522:98"/> from this World in the Soul which ſo practiſes.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Now for proper directions to this purpoſe the following particulars may be effectual. 1. <hi>Set bounds to thy own deſires,</hi> and even to thy <hi>deſigns of getting:</hi> Conſider with thy ſelf what may ſuffice thee and thine, and reſolve to acquieſce therein, not concerning thy ſelf to be farther rich. And for adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and determining what may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; Conſult not ſo much with the <hi>Cravings of unreaſonable Appetite,</hi> or with <hi>Opinion,</hi> (I might ſay, Pride and Ambition) as with the <hi>Neceſſities and Conveniences of Nature;</hi> and of thy <hi>Degree,</hi> Station or Condition; Plain and Common People ought not to think of living equal to the Gentry; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men not of living like Nobles; and proportionably is it to be reſolved touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men of other Orders and Degrees. Now ſuch meaſures being taken, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them Men propounding to themſelves no more, than what may comfortably carry them, in ſuch or ſuch a rank, through the World, leaving to theirs what may alſo with Vertue and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40522:99"/> Induſtry, as beforeſaid, ſupport them like their Relatives; we ſhall find the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Men might moſt reaſonably take up within much narrower bounds, than uſually they do, and ſo make their Lives much happier, their Hopes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bleſſedneſs much more aſſured, and their Deaths much more Comfortable than are the Lives, Hopes, and Deaths of moſt Common Chriſtians. For ſuch People can neither live happily, nor die comfortably, who ſtill ſpend their whole time in getting, or in aiming at, more. There muſt be time to uſe, to enjoy, and then to diſpoſe of, as well as to get, if we will have comfort either in Life or Death. And ſuch times thoſe can never have, who never think they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but are ſtill crying and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing More, More, and plodding for it. How ſoon might that Man be rich, who would ſatisfie himſelf with the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or even decent Conveniencies of Nature? And theſe certainly moſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to ſatisfie themſelves with: But what Man can ever be rich, who accuſtoms himſelf to eſteem nothing to himſelf a ſuperfluity, and ſo nothing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40522:99"/> enough? Alas, how little is it that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires, and what a little more, with Frugality and Prudence, would ſupply or adminiſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent conveniencies; It is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si ad Naturam vives nunquam eris pauper: Si ad Opinionem, nunquam eris dives. Exigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Natura de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderat, Opinio immenſum. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t</hi> Seneca <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 6.</note> ſtill, I ſay, only Opinion that ſuffers not Men of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Eſtates to be rich, for Opinion indeed never will be ſatisfied. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who will not ſet due bounds to their deſires, with reſpect to the requiſits of Nature, and the Condition of themſelves and theirs, muſt in the greateſt plenty, ſtill be poor, unſatisfied, unquiet, in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual turmoil, and in moſt uneaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; and conſequently moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Death. Indeed ſuch Perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived in the greateſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to have either Mind or Eſtate ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. This therefore muſt be reſolv'd on in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>Now to be ſhort ſuch competency ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haſt, or thou haſt not. If thou haſt, thy buſineſs is, as ſoon as may be, ſo to ſettle all as will preſently be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. If thou haſt not, conſider what
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40522:100"/> way of living thou art in? Is it ſuch, as therein thou haſt a reaſonable proſpect before thee, that by induſtrious proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thy Calling, or way of Life, thou ſhalt get what thou judgeſt may be a Competency? Or elſe, art thou a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an unſettled rambling Mind and Life, fixt in no Calling, living at large, or what is the ſame in effect, living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides or beyond thy ſelf? If any of the latter, 'tis a hard, if not an impoſſible thing, for thee, ſhouldeſt thou go out of the World ſpeedily, to ſettle thy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs or Mind, and conſequently to be prepared for Death. All thou canſt do is, to take the beſt advice thou may'ſt with ſerious and diſcreet Friends, amongſt which ſome Spiritual Guide ought to be conſulted, what can be done according to thy particular circumſtances; for theſe may be ſo various, or ſo intricate, that no Man without thy imparting them, can give any pertinent advice as to thee or them. Suppoſe thou ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt this unſettled condition, thou muſt immediately fix or retrench, and then the caſe will ſoon alter with thee, and thou wilt come within the compaſs of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40522:100"/> ſome of the following Directions. If thou doeſt not ſurvive, as to what can be done, the Directions now given are the ſumm.</p>
               <p>But if a Man, having not yet obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Competency, be in a good Calling and fair way of thriving, let him in the Name of God comfortably, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and induſtriouſly proceed in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, <hi>ſeeking</hi> ever <hi>firſt the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and expecting with Faith and Submiſſion God's Bleſſing upon his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Induſtry. Such Perſon, if he be taken off in this courſe, need not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet his Mind touching his Worldly Concerns. God will provde for thoſe, whom he vouchſafed not to the Pious Parent life to provide for. <hi>Leave thy fatherleſs children, I will preſerve them alive, and let thy widows truſt in me.</hi> Jer. 49. 11. In the mean while that ſuch induſtrious hopeful thriving (though perhaps not rich) Men may leave their Affairs as ſettled, and ſo their Minds as quiet, as in their Condition is poſſible, ſhould they ſuddenly be taken off, I would adviſe them inſtantly to do, what they would do, were it ſaid to them as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40522:101"/> to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſai. 36. <hi>Thou ſhalt forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with die and not live,</hi> (I mean were they ſure they ſhould die within a few days) Conſider with thy ſelf, my ſerious hopeful Friend, what wouldſt thou do in ſuch Caſe? Even the very ſelf ſame thing <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> or for the main, that any honeſt rich Man ſhould do. And what is the next Direction? Thou wouldſt <hi>as far as thou art able be Just to all Men.</hi> Do this therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art Rich or Poor, in Order to the Diſentangling thee from the World, and having thy Concerns and Mind in a ſettled poſture; namely,</p>
               <p>§. 4. 2dly, <hi>Put thy Worldly Affairs into ſuch Order,</hi> as to be to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of thy Power, <hi>Juſt to all.</hi> If thou art a dealer, ſet thy Books ſtraight, and keep them well. If otherwiſe, and ſo that thou keepeſt no Books, let ſome faithful Friends know thy Eſtate and Fortunes; Take care not to keep all private to thy ſelf: Remember St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Preſcript to all Chriſtian People, Rom. 13. 8. <hi>Owe no Man any thing but to love one another.</hi> At leaſt if neceſſity inforce thee that thou muſt owe, <hi>Contract not</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:40522:101"/> 
                  <hi>ſecret debts;</hi> Thou wilt forget them, and thy Heirs or Executors cannot be preſumed to know the State of them. Have no account of long ſtanding; let not old reckonings lie unſettled. Theſe things may be eaſily done in Health, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and Leiſure; they are in a manner impoſſible to one on a Death-bed.</p>
               <p>Conſider with thy ſelf, thou art to be Juſt to all the World; Juſt to thine own, Juſt to Strangers; And he who is not Juſt to both, can ſcarce be Juſt to either: Now there is no ſuch prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to be juſt to both, as to be open, and all above-board in our Eſtates and Concerns. For where things are ſecret, the Covetouſneſs of ſome will wrong the other, which plain free ſettling of things had prevented. The adjuſting accounts only when People are going out of the World, beſides that it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of miſerable diſtraction and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to the Dying Perſon, is generally imperfect (as being done in a hurry, with half attention and ſhort Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) and many times leaves divers flaws, which are afterward matter of many Contentions and great Damage.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40522:102"/> This therefore by thoſe, who would be always prepared for Death, muſt be done at ſome diſtance, and in time of leiſure and compoſedneſs. It comes therefore juſtly in this place.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>3dly,</hi> If in this enquiry into, or, as I may call it Rummaging of thine eſtate, any part come to thy memory (or any conſiderable thing come to thy hand) which thou haſt unjuſtly got, <hi>ſeparate that from all the reſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to the true owner or owners;</hi> or, in caſe of their deceaſe, to his or their <hi>Kindred or Heirs:</hi> Or finally, in caſe theſe cannot be found, or are at a diſtance and cannot be come at, give it or ſome better thing, (more worth than the true value of it, when firſt it came into thy poſſeſſion) to the Poor. Leave not any thing unjuſtly gotten to thy Heirs. There is a ſtrange unaccountable Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker through the juſt judgment of God, commonly attending all Goods, Eſtates, or parts of Eſtates diſhoneſtly gotten; and 'tis better to leave a Man's poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty honeſtly poor, than unjuſtly rich; If any except againſt this Direction as too ſevere, and what may utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40522:102"/> many, let them remember the Frank and publick Profeſſion of a good Publican, when he reſolved to be for Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>Behold, if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word ſignifies a peculiar abuſe of his office (too long here to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain) and ſo the import of the Text is, If in my way of living I have wrongfully gotten any thing from any man, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to reſtore double to what the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law required of a Thief, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 2. Now that which we have preſs'd, is only ſimple reſtitution of the thing or value, at which no reaſonable or conſcientious perſon can except. And this if thou canſt do at preſent, do ſo; if not at preſent, yet make ſuch proviſion, that after thy deceaſe it may be truly done.</p>
               <p>§. 6. <hi>4thly,</hi> Standing thus fairly with all abroad, as to <hi>thoſe nearer thee,</hi> who have dependance upon thee, <hi>put them into,</hi> or contrive for them, <hi>the beſt and readieſt way of living thou canst.</hi> None ſhould ever think of breeding, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought they to be careful not to leave a child to idleneſs; or which is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40522:103"/> much the ſame, to no Employment. Such who will not take to one thing, would do well at another. Let each have ſomething to follow, if it be but to keep them from waſting too faſt, what thou maiſt leave them. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially endeavour to ſecure them all in a Vertuous and Induſtrious way of living. Vertue and Induſtry are the moſt ſecure and laſting fortune in this world, and beſides the faireſt way to a better and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Inheritance. It is a very wholeſome note if we duly <note place="margin">In <hi>Iſai.</hi> cap. 38.</note> time it, that <hi>Calvin</hi> has on <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s being commanded to ſet his houſe in Order: <q>Our chiefeſt care, ſays he, herein ſhould be, not ſo much touching Legacies and appointing Heirs and Executors, but to provide for <note place="margin">Praecipua Cura eſſe debet, non legatorum &amp; inſtitutionis hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redis, ſed ut eorum quos dominus Curae noſtrae commiſit ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti conſulatur.</note> the ſalvation of thoſe whom God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our care.</q> This I ſay, (and am content to think the Author ſuppoſed) ought to be practiſed at a covenient diſtance, as near as we can from death, and before we make
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40522:103"/> our wills, for then commonly it is of the lateſt. However this leads to the next particular.</p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>5ly,</hi> If thou wouldeſt have thy mind in ſuch frame, and thy worldly matters in ſuch order as to be ever ready at thy Lord's call, <hi>Live not without a Will by thee,</hi> ſuppoſing thou haſt any thing to diſpoſe of. This is not only prudence, but ordinarily duty. For in caſe we ſhould be ſuddenly taken away, how elſe can we be juſt to others; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our neighbours abroad, or to thoſe at home of our own Blood and Family? It was we know in expreſs terms by God commanded to good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative for Death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 1. And we may obſerve ſome who have had little care of making any other preparation for Death, not to have been negligent in this behalf. <hi>Achitophel</hi> would <hi>ſet his houſe in order,</hi> though his next buſineſs was to <hi>hang himſelf.</hi> A dreadful inſtance of a worldly wiſe, but irreligious, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man: Notwithſtanding, what may well mind us of our Lord's obſervation on Mammoniſts, <hi>The children of this world are in their generation wiſe than the</hi>

                  <hi>children of light,</hi> Luk. 16. 8. Let us not then diſdain to imitate any in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do wiſely, as long as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with good conſcience. And ſuch certainly is, what at preſent is urged.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning making our wills, let us conſider, it is one of the ſolemneſt and weightieſt acts of our lives, and therefore to be done: (1) <hi>In the fear of God and with great conſideration and conſcience, without Paſſion and fond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</hi> For a Man's laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to ſurvive him, (let it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a Monument of the Teſtator's folly, injuſtice or Vice) and the effects of it may be almoſt immortal. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (2.) it will not be amiſs ordinarily to take advice not ſo much of Learned Lawyers (though in many caſes that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is to be done) as of prudent and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtian Friends; by whoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if not on our own heads, we may inſert into our wills ſome Tokens of our Faith and Chriſtian Hope; ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, Proviſo's or Conditions, which may oblige our poſterity to what they perhaps would otherwiſe neglect; we may hereby be Benefactors to their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40522:104"/> ſouls a long time after our death. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever certainly a Chriſtian Man's Will ſhould beſpeak him ſeriouſly a Chriſtian. And,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If we have wherewithal, <hi>let us not forget the Poor.</hi> It were better indeed to do that ſooner, that we might have the Prayers of the Poor to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our departing ſouls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9. But whether we have been liberal before or not, ſomething of this kind ought not to be omitted in any able perſons laſt Will. The beſt of us commonly have ſome odd ends of Debts of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if not of juſt recompence to the Poor, which it is needful we pay, when going our long journey.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>6thly,</hi> Beſides this <hi>Charity</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there may be alſo <hi>another part in forgiving,</hi> very neceſſary to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of moſt perſons minds, eſpecially when they are looking toward death, as well as otherwiſe requiſire to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them for appearing before God. <hi>For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will alſo forgive you. But if you forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40522:105"/> your treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 6. 14, 15. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile therefore thy ſelf, as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to Mankind, and take care to live ſo reconciled. As to making amends for any ſatisfiable wrong done by our ſelves, as it is comprized in the nature of true repentance, ſo it has been there, and lately lookt to and preſt; and is ſuppoſed already done. But we may alſo have ſuffered, as well as done wrong; and whether all men may have been juſt to us or no, we are as we have ſeen by the condition aſſigned by our Lord, for our very own pardon, obliged to be charitable to them. Let therefore no mans injuſtice imbitter our ſpirits; for any revengeful inclination or affection will be doubly to our own injury, firſt in obſtructing our pardon in the Court of Heaven; then in diſturbing our peace within our ſelves. The deſire of revenge is very far from being in it ſelf at any time an eaſie and tame paſſion, much leſs can it be matter of comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reflection to any one of good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or conſiſting with inward peace. And certainly we have need of all good Conſcience, of all comforts and peace
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40522:105"/> poſſible, to fortifie us againſt death, that laſt Enemy.</p>
               <p>Nor will a good man only take care that his own heart be pacified, but he will have ſo much charity for others, who perhaps have been uncharitable enough to him, to endeavour the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of theirs alſo, before he go out of the world. If any man bear me a grudge, though without my fault, I cannot give a more Chriſtian Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my forgiving him, than by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to deliver him before I die from under that ſin. And I ought to be the more careful herein, becauſe I cannot tell but ſome ſinful infirmities of mine own, may have more provoked him, and given him (in his opinion) juſter cauſe of offence, than I am aware of; and what is juſt in his opinion, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for him to adhere to, till he be convinced otherwiſe. Now what ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py way to bring ſuch perſon to reaſon, as the melting addreſſes of a dying man, or of one who is as dying? The making up therefore of all quarrels betwixt us and others, yea though we are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, not the injurious party, is very

But the larger Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections will be of another place.

               <p>The ſame may I ſay <hi>as to any ſecrets</hi> which we have to impart, and which it is expedient our Friends or Relations ſhould know, convenient time in ſtate of health and leiſure, may be taken, and needful Prefaces uſed, ſo as to impart them even at a diſtance from our death. Or if the ſecrets be of ſuch nature, as it is not expedient our Friends ſhould
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40522:107"/> know them when we are in health, or till we are going, or gone out of the world, a Letter may be writ, and put up ſealed with our Will, to ſuch perſon, to whom the ſecret does belong: Or in caſe we are not able to write, ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend, with whom we can, or do, intruſt the ſecrets of our Eſtate, may be intruſted herewith, to impart it to our Friends at or after our death. By theſe or like means, which common diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſuggeſt, may a man before hand diſcharge his Conſcience to his Friends, ſo as to have his mind, even in reference to them, compoſed and eaſie, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at a diſtance as ready for death, as if it were at hand.</p>
               <p>§. 10.

               <p>Let him now from henceforth work his will, and diſpoſe of thee and thine as he pleaſes.

               <p>§. 11. This is plainly a moſt eaſeful and bleſſed temper, able in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to felicitate any perſon. Whoſoever has thus practiſed, and continues in this ſtate and practice, is plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death. For the three afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned intentions (beyond which in this period we could ſee nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) are attained: He has a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to go to (the infinite God is his Portion.) He has provided againſt all he can fear, ſin and the wrath due to it. Sin he has forſaken, and endeavoured to extirpate, and the guilt of it (that is obligation to the wrath due) is done
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40522:108"/> away; for he has made his peace with God in Chriſt; and he has diſintangled himſelf from the world: He may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take up good old <hi>Simeon</hi>'s Hymn, <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> And add thereto St. <hi>John</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſe to the Churches Invitatory, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

                  <head>Matter and a Method for Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuitable to Chapter the Fifth.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IN point of</hi> Examination <hi>or Inquiry into our condition, here will be</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a new nature, <hi>and different from what as yet came before us. For hitherto in our Devotional engagements, the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we have ſtill made, were touching diſorders of heart, or our particular guilt, (Sins Habitual or Actual.) But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged, as well to ſettle our worldly affairs, as to purge our Souls and quiet our minds, and the purging, diſentang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and quieting our ſelves depending ſo much on our outward circumſtances. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch endeavours of a ſerious thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper and ſhort Prayer, as uſual at our entring into our privacy, we must</hi> look without, <hi>and ſet our ſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in plain terms,</hi> What eſtate or worldly ſubſtance we have, and how it lyes? <hi>What</hi> Relations <hi>alſo, and</hi> Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants? <hi>Or what</hi> Dependencies <hi>we our</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:40522:109"/> 
                     <hi>ſelves have upon others? What</hi> Dealings <hi>and</hi> Contracts <hi>we are engaged in? What our</hi> Debts and Credits? <hi>Theſe queſtions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt ſeriouſly put to our ſelves, and endeavour true anſwers and accompts, in the fear of God, as really making matter of Conſcience of ſuch Inqueſt. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this kind of practice a perſon that has had any thing to do in the world, or has lived any conſiderable time therein, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſt to the world, when he goes out of it. And for directing to ſuch work as this, in quality of a matter of Conſcience, and a work of ſecret or Cloſet-Devotion, I have great reaſon, in as much as good conſcience, and our peace both with God and our ſelves, is ſo intimately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. For 'tis moſt certain a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die a good Christian, or with juſt hopes of Heaven, except he die, to his power, a juſt man. In plain</hi> Engliſh <hi>then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt buſineſs here thou haſt to do is,</hi> To make a true and plain Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of thy Eſtate, Debts and Credits. <hi>This however it may be too tedious to be done by thy ſelf in ſecret, yet it muſt be</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:40522:110"/> 
                     <hi>here reſolved upon, ordered to be done, and a general contrivance of it laid. At leaſt, when done, it will be expedient in ſecret between God and thy ſelf to</hi> View, Examine and Conſider it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Next, being thou art upon Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death, which ſtrips thee of all, thou muſt</hi> ſet thy ſelf in good earneſt to think of parting with all, <hi>and bidding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu (at leaſt</hi> in heart and affection, <hi>at the very preſent) to this world. To make thee ſerious in ſuch thought,</hi> Poſſeſs thy ſelf (by way of Meditation) <hi>of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Points briefly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is appointed for all men once to die, <hi>and this fate moſt certainly and unavoidably attends thee in particular. Thou must die; But thou</hi> knoweſt not <hi>(that is men in health and common Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances generally know not)</hi> How, <hi>(by what mean, in what condition,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>nor</hi> when, <hi>nor</hi> where, <hi>whether by a diſeaſe, or by accident as we ſpeak? Whether</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:40522:110"/> 
                     <hi>in thy ſenſes and with uſe of ſpeech,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or not? Whether to morrow, or the next Day, or next Week, or Month; or even this night may thy ſoul be required of thee. Whether at home, in thy bed, or in the field,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Death deprives thee of the enjoyment of all things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here. <hi>No poſſible fruit to thee of any the least part of what thou haſt after death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it not then much better, and more becoming <hi>a reaſonable being (much more a wiſe diſcreet perſon, as we would be thought to be)</hi> to part with all, conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gravely, willingly and in good order, <hi>than by conſtraint, in a hurry to be ſnatcht away, with both Mind and Eſtate all in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Thou art no whit the nearer Death when a wiſe, creditable, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40522:111"/> diſpoſal of all is made than before: Only thou art readier for it, let it come how and when God pleaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A brief Meditation upon theſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Heads methinks ſhould diſpoſe a man to the practice of all the Directions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Body of the Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>As to point</hi> of Prayer; <hi>the matter hereof will be to ſeveral perſons differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, according to their different conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to this world. Yet I think men of all conditions, rich and poor, may agree in the following Particulars as too common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pertinent and ſeaſonable enough unto all ſorts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of Confeſſion, <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth and bewailing their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion to this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of Petition, <hi>beging of God a diſentangled heart, a mind content with ſuch things as we have; Heavenly affections, true Chriſtian contempt of this world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:40522:111"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as to the</hi> differences of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>in this Point. By the reſult of the first Point of Enquiry above mentioned, Particular perſons will find themſelves in different Conditions; namely either</hi> Rich <hi>or</hi> Poor, <hi>or</hi> in a midling conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>And it is to be remembred here, what has been above ſuggested, we must eſtimate our ſelves Rich or Poor with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our Degree or Rank. An ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſon that is worth five hundred Pound is truly richer than a Perſon of Quality, or a Nobleman, that dies worth five thouſand, perhaps fifty thouſand.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Now in caſe upon ſuch Enquiry or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination as above, we find our ſelves rich, or conſidering our Quality not Poor, but in good midling condition. Here will be,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Matter of further Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Examination, <hi>whether this Eſtate was gotten by our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or left us. If the former, have we got it juſtly in a fair induſtrious way of following our Vocation? Or have we not oppreſt ſome particular Perſons or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40522:112"/> to inrich our ſelves. In ſuch caſe,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(4) <hi>To</hi> take Advice; <hi>ſo that here there must be ſomething of</hi> Confeſſion to Man, <hi>at leaſt to a Friend or Spiritual Guide. Which being done, or for the preſent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly reſolved upon,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5) Prayer and Supplication <hi>to God for pardon muſt ſucceed. The ſin and its aggravations are to be conſidered; how long lived in? Againſt what light, what checks</hi>

                     <hi>of Conſcience? And accordingly our Prayers muſt be more earneſt, and ſo in due method peace is to be made with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On the other ſide, if the Body of the Eſtate we have were left us, yet here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain will be</hi> (1) Matter of Enquiry, <hi>and Self-examination, What Stewards we have been? Have we encreaſed our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, or been Prodigal? Have we been the better for being ſo early provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for? Have we more improved our Souls in Knowledge and in Vertue, by means of the liberal fortunes left us by our Anceſtors, or of our liberal Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſequent to that, and of leiſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to all? Have we done good to our Poor Neighbours, Relations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in caſe we have increaſed our Paternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, by what means did we ſo encreaſe it? By juſt or unjuſt practices? Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all thoſe, and poſſibly more differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which enquiry will ſuggeſt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But admit all be found to be just, (or indeed whether it be or no) it will still concern</hi> all rich perſons <hi>in Prayer,</hi> (1) <hi>To</hi> beg of God pardon for all unknown ſins in way of inriching themſelves, <hi>or but of keeping and maintaining what they have; for unknown ſins all men have.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2) <hi>To give</hi> Praiſe and Thanſgiving <hi>to that Bountiful God, whoſe</hi> bleſſing <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> maketh rich, <hi>and who has not taken vengeance on them to blast their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.</hi>

                     <hi>Again in the other caſe, ſuppoſe we find our ſelves poor, or (which is little better) incumbred.
